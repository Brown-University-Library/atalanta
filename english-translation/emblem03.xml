                  <lb/>together with the <choice><orig>f√¶ces</orig><reg>feces</reg></choice> may be drawne out by the heat of the <orig>Sunne</orig>, as by

                  <lb/><orig>foule</orig> and <unclear reason="illegible"><orig>uncleane</orig></unclear>, <orig>doe</orig> become pure, and <subst><del>purged</del><add>free</add></subst> from spots: This is the art of
                  <lb/>women, which they learned from Nature herselfe:<milestone unit="section" n="e03-02"/> for wee see, that if the bones of
                  <lb/>animalls, which at first are blacke and filthy, be exposed to the aire, and often
                  <lb/>washd with raine, and dryed agayne by the heat of the Sunne often coming upon
                  <lb/>them, they will, as Isaacke notes, be reduced to perfect whitenesse: The same
                  <lb/>allso were observd in the philosophicall subject, whatsoever crudityes and fae
                  <lb break="no"/>ces appear, they are purged and taken away by <del>their</del>waters poured on, and the
                  <lb/>body <del>is</del>brought to great clarity and perfection. For all Chymicall operations,
                  <lb/>as Calcination, Sublimation, Solution, Distillation, Doscension, Coagulation, Fixa
                  <lb break="no"/>tion, and the rest, are perfected by ablution alone: For hee that washeth an
                  <lb/>impure thing with water, performs the same thing, as is accomplished by soe
                  <lb/>many forms of operating: For, as the philosophers Rosary sayth, the linnen of
                  <lb/>prime Duenech being defiled by sweat, must be washed by fire, and burned
                  <lb/>by water: by which fire and water seem to have given one another mutuall qua
                  <lb break="no"/>lityes, or that the philosophicall fire is not of the same kind with comon fire, and
                  <lb/>the same must be supposd of the water. As for Calx vive, and ignis Graecus wee
                  <lb/>know that they are kindled by water, and noe wise extinguished, contrary to
                  <lb/>the nature of other things that are subject to take fire: soe they affirme that
                  <lb/>Camphore being kindled before burnes in water: and the Stone calld Gagates (as
                  <lb/>Ansell de Bood attests) being kindled is more easily extinguished by oyle
                  <lb/>than <del>by</del>water: for Oyle is <del><unclear reason="illegible">mik</unclear></del>mixed with it, and suffocates the fired body:
                  <lb/>water not being able to mix itselfe with fattnesse, gives place to the body
                  <lb/>being fired, unlesse it alltogether cover and overwhelme it: but that can
                  <lb break="no"/>not easily be done, because it is a stone, and swims upon the top of the
                  <lb/>water, as all oyle: Soe Naphta, Petroleum, and the like being kindled doe
                  <lb/>not much fear water. Some write of the Subterranean coals in the dominion
                  <lb/>of Siege, that being kindled in the earth, they cannot be extinguished by
                  <lb/>water, but onely by throwing and heaping the dust of the earth upon them:
                  <lb/>as Cor: Tacitus declares of the like kind of fire, which cannot be quenched
                  <lb/>by water, but onely by clubs, and garments taken of from the body: there
                  <lb/>is therefore a great diversity of fires, <!-- numbers above words again -->and noe lesse of liquors, in exciting
                  <lb/>and in extinguishing, because milke, vinegar, Spirit of wine, Aqua fortis,
                  <lb/>aqua Regia, and comon water doe differ much one from another, as to com
                  <lb break="no"/>parison with fire: nor this onely, but allso the matter itselfe doth some
                  <lb break="no"/>times sustaine fire, as those fine Byssinian cloaths, formerly used and
                  <lb/>esteemed by rich men, which were washd, or reduced to former cleanesse,
                  <lb/>by fire, not by water, the faeces being burned away: Whatsoever some men
                  <lb/>vainly talke of the haires of the reptile Salamander, as if incombustible

                  <lb/>Elychnia <add>or <orig>lamp<unclear reason="illegible">-wiecks</unclear></orig><reg>lamp-wicks</reg></add> may be made thereof, is not to be regarded:<milestone unit="section" n="e03-"/> Some there be who of a
                  <lb/>truth <orig>affirme</orig> that in times past a texture was praepared of Talko, plumous Alum,
                  <lb/>and such other matters, which was frequently purged by fire, but that the art
                  <lb/>was lost and extinct with the artist (a woman of Antwerp) through envy, and that
                  <lb/>the same temperament could not be found afterwards: Wee doe not here speake of
                  <lb/>combustible matters: The philosophicall Subject must be considered according
                  <lb/>to all these differences, if at any time it be praepared: for fire, water, and matter
                  <lb/>itselfe is here not comon: for the philosophers fire is water, and water fire:
                  <lb/>their water doth at once both wash and calcine, soe allso their fire: and the
                  <lb/>cloaths which are to be washd have the nature of the byssinean textures, or
                  <lb/>praepares Talko, the temperament of which and art of praeparation is allso
                  <lb/>not obvious to all men: <milestone unit=""/><seg rend="underline">To wash them, they make a Lixivium, or Lye, not
                  <lb/>with the ashes, or salt of Oaks, but <orig>metallicke</orig>, which is more durable than
