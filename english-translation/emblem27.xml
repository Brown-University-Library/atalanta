                        <lb break="no"/>pentine and without humane feet. Very like him are those, who, depending upon
                        <lb/>the means of Vulcan alone, without the wisedome of Pallas, doe begett monstrous
                        <lb/>children, namely, without feet and abortive, which can neither sustaine<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>themselves, nor profit others: It is a miserable thing for a man to goe on all
                        <lb/>foure, that is, hands and feet together, but much more miserable to be all
                        <lb break="no"/>together destitute of feet, and to use armes instead thereof: for they seem to
                        <lb/>have degenerated to the nature of wormes, who goe after the manner of crea
                        <lb break="no"/>ping wormes: But the two leggs are the organicke parts in man, without which
                        <lb/>hee cannot truely walke, as neither see without eyes, or touch things tangible
                        <lb/>without hands: soe likewise Medicine and every operative art is supposd to
                        <lb/>have two leggs, whereon to stand, namely experience and reason, without<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>either of which that art is lame, and imperfect in its traditions and præ
                        <lb break="no"/>cepts, nor correspondent to the proposed end: Chymistry indeed cheifely de
                        <lb break="no"/>lights in two subjects (as leggs) whereof one is the key, the other the string of
                        <lb/>the barre; by these the Philosophicall Rosary lockd on all sides is opened,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>and passage admitted into it to those that have right to enter: But if one
                        <lb/>be wanting to him that is about to enter herein it will be the same thing, as
                        <lb/>for a man whose feet are bound to endeavour to outrunne a hare: hee that
                        <lb/>enters into the garden, which is every way enclosed or fenced, without a Key,
                        <lb/>imitates a theife, who coming in a darke night can discerne nothing that<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>growes in the garden, nor enjoy the things stolen away: But the key is a thing
                        <lb/>of very little esteeme or value, which is properly called a stone knowne in the
                        <lb/>chapters, and is the root of Rhodes, without which a twig is not put forth, nor<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>doth the bud swell, nor the Rose become green, or discover multitude of<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>leaves: But a quæstion might be askd, where must this key be sought for?
                        <lb/>I anwser with the oracle, that is must be there investigated, where the<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>bones of Orestes are sayd to be found, namely, where winds, the Striker, that
                        <lb/>which is beaten backe, and the destruction of men are found together, that is,
                        <lb/>as Lychas hath interpreted it, in the Brasiers Shop or workehouse: For the oracle
                        <lb/>would have bellowes understood by winds; a hammer by the striker an anvile
                        <lb/>by that which is beaten backe; by the destruction of men iron: if a man knowes
                        <lb/>how to number well and distinguish the signs, hee will certainly find this key
                        <lb/>in the northerne hemisphere of the Zodiacke, and the string of the barre in
                        <lb/>the Southerne: Which having obtaind, it will be easy to open the doore and enter:
                        <lb/>and in the very entrance hee will see Venus with her Paramour Adonis: for shee
                        <lb/>hath tinged the white roses of a purple colour with her blood: In the same place
                        <lb/>allso a dragon is observed, as in the Hesperian gardens, which watched to præ
                        <lb break="no"/>serve the roses: The scent of the roses is sayd to be increased by garlicke<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>planted near, and that by reason of an exceding degree of heat, which appears
                        <lb/>in garlicke, in which respect it is a remedy against cold poysons: for Roses<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>scent most gratefull to the eyes and nose: Moreove the fume of comon Sulphur
                        <lb/>makes red roses white, where it toucheth, on the contrary the spirit of Vitrioll
                        <lb/>or Aqua fortis restores them to a deep red colour, which endureth: For comon<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Sulphur is an enemy to the Philosophicall Sulphur, though it cannot destroy it,
                        <lb/>but the Solutive water is freindly, and præserves its colour: The rose is conse

                        <lb/>for it is a Virgin, which nature hath armed, that it might not be violated with
                        <lb break="no"/>out revenge and punnishment: Violets are voyd of weapons, and trodden under
                        <lb/>foot; Roses being comprised within prickles have yellow haire inwardly; and
                        <lb/>outwardly a green garment: Noe man can plucke, and separate them from<pc>-</pc>
