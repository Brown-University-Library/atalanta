                        <lb/>be a passage from the sense to the understanding as by a doore: for nothing is
                        <lb/>sayd to be in the understanding, which had not admission by some sense,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>the understanding of a mannew borne being supposd as a smooth table,<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>things: Atalanta is renowned by the Poets for <add>speed in</add> running, in which exercise
                        <lb/>shee surpassed all her suitors, and therefore, the reward of victory being
                        <lb/>propounded, death ensued to these <subst><del>being</del><add>that were</add></subst> overrunne by the Virgin, till Shee
                        <lb/>herselfe was overcome by Hippomenes, a youth <subst><del>more</del><add>very</add></subst> hardy and circumspect,
                        <lb/>casting three golden apples at <add>three</add> severall times in her way, which taking up,
                        <lb/>Shee was in the meane time outgone by him, being now near and touching<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>the goale: as this Atalanta runns, soe one Musicall note allwayes runns before
                        <lb/>another as Hippomenes, and the other followes: yet they are established and
                        <lb/>confirmed in a third, which is single and of one validity as a golden apple:
                        <lb/>This same virgin is merely Chymicall, namely Philosophicall Mercury<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>fixed in flight and restrained by the golden Sulphur, <note place="margin" n="x"><!-- symbol for alchemical Mercury --></note>which if a man<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>not, destruction and ruine of his affaires: From Hippomenes and Atalanta
                        <lb/>lying together in the temple of the mother of the Gods, that is, a vessell,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>are Lyons produced, or they acquire a red colour: This virgin allso obtaind
                        <lb/>a victory before men, killing a certaine boar of notable bignesse, for which
                        <lb/>Shee was rewarded by Meleager: Striking a rocke at Slethæus the temple
                        <lb/>of Æsculapius Shee brought forth water, <subst><del>which</del><add>whereof</add></subst> being thirsty, Shee dranke:
                        <lb/>which things being truely allegoricall and emblematicall, and noe way
                        <lb/>historicall, I was willing that this intellectual emblematicall treatise<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Should indigitate and take notice of them in commemoration of this noble
                        <lb/>Heroesse, especially the apples cast before her being taken out of the<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>this observed, that every disticke being conveniently adapted to those three
                        <lb/>voyces may be expressd in singing, in which soe many varietyes of flights
