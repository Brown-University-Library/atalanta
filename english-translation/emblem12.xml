                        <lb/>they will not declare those things which are elswhere spoken of Saturne,
                        <lb/>why hee devoured and vomited up his sonns, and a stone instead of Jupiter,
                        <lb/>why hee is the discoverer of truth, why appearing with a sieth, <!-- scyth? -->a serpent,
                        <lb/>blacknesse, morosity, and distorted feet? Herein the last thinke themselves to
                        <lb/>interpret best, saying, that time revealed and manifests truth, slided away as a Ser
                        <lb break="no"/>pent, cuts all things downe with death as by a sieth, devoured its children, that is,
                        <lb/>all those things which it hath generated, digests hard stones, or cannot consume
                        <lb/>them, and therefore dos as it were vomit them up againe: These things doe indeed
                        <lb/>agree in part, but are not consonant to the truth of the thing, and all circum
                        <lb break="no"/>stances. But the exercises Philosophers doe say, that Saturne is first in their
                        <lb/>worke, which if hee be really praesent, they cannot erre, truth is discovered in
                        <lb/>darknesse; but there is nothing besides blacknesse: wherefore they say in
                        <lb/>Turba Philosophorum, whatsoever colour comes after blacknesse is laudable:
                        <lb/>and when you see your matter blacke, rejoyce, because it is the begining of
                        <lb/>the worke: And, when it is first blacke, wee say it is the key of the worke,
                        <lb/>because it is not effected without blacknesse, as the Rosary hath it, with Arnold,
                        <lb/>and the Speculum: when you are operating, endeavour to obtaine first a
                        <lb/>blacke colour, and then will you be certaine that you putrefy, and process
                        <lb/>the right way. And a little after: that blacknesse is called earth, which is made
                        <lb/>by light decoction soe often repeated, till blacknesse be most eminent. For
                        <lb/>this reason say the same, that Saturne possesseth the earth, Mercury water,
                        <lb/>Jupiter aire, Sol fire. Saturne therefore is blacknesse, the discoverer of truth,
                        <lb/>who followes a stone instead of Jupiter. For blacknesse, that is, a darke cloud
                        <lb/>covers the stone as first, that is cannot be seen: Therefore sayth Morienes
                        <lb/>every body without a soule is darke and obscure: And Hermes: Take his head
                        <lb/>dissolve it with the Sharpest vinegar, or the vine of children, till it be made
                        <lb/>darke: This being performed hee lines in putrefaction, and the darke clouds which
                        <lb/>were upon him, and in his body, before hee dyed, are returned. This stone is 
                        <lb/>againe disgorged by Saturne, when it becomes white, and then is it sett upon
                        <lb/>the top of Helicon for a monument to men, as Hesiod writes: for whitenesse is
                        <lb/>really comprehended under blacknesse, which is drawne out of its bowells, that
                        <lb/>out of the stomacke of Saturne. therefore sayth Democritus; putrify Tinne <!-- unsure about this -->
                        <lb/>with a peculiar ablution, draw its blacknesse and obscurity from it, and the
                        <lb/>whitenesse of it will appear. And in Turba it is sayd: Joyne the dry with
                        <lb/>the moist, that is, the blacke earth with its water, and coct, till it be whitened.
                        <lb/>This Arnold in Novum lumen chapt. 4. excellently declares, saying; That
                        <lb/>moisture therefore which caused blacknesse in decoction, Shews itselfe to be
                        <lb/>dryed, when the white colour begins to appear. And a little after: And
                        <lb/>my Master sayd to mee, that that brunity ascended, because the whitenesse

                        <lb/>was drawne out of the belly of its blacknesse, as is sayd in Turba: For when
                        <lb/>you see it blacke know that the whitenesse of it is hidden in the bowells of the
                        <lb/>blacknesse first appearing: As the same blacknesse is called Saturne, soe allso
                        <lb/>Lead: Thereupon sayth Agadimon in Turba: Coct your brasse, till the blacknesse come forth,
                        <lb/>which they call money, and mix the matters of your art, and you will find blacknesse
                        <lb/>presently, which is the Philosophers lead, of which they have treated much in their
                        <lb/>books: Hitherto relates the saying of Emigamy, that the splendor of Saturne ascending
                        <lb/>into the aire appears noe otherwise than darkened. And of Plato in the Rosary; The
                        <lb/>first way of governing Saturne is to putrefy and put it upon Sol: by which it is evident
                        <lb/>that the sense of the Philosophers, speaking of Saturne, is farre different from the
                        <lb/>comon acceptation. This Saturne generates Jupiter, that is, an obscure whitenesse, Jupiter
                        <lb/>of Latona Diana, that is perfect whitenesse, and Apollo, that is, rednesse; and this is
                        <lb/>the successive mutation of all perfect colours: This Stone cast out by Saturne is
                        <lb/>reported to be placed at the top of the mountaine as a monument to men, which
                        <lb/>is a thing most true
