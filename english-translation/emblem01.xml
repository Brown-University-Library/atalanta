                        <lb/>in his Smaragdine table elegantly, though concisely, describe the naturalle
                        <lb/>worke, where amongst other things hee sayth: the wind carrys him in his
                        <lb/>belly: as if hee should say, Hee, whose father is Sol, and mother Luna,
                        <lb/>must, before hee can be brought to light, be carryed by windy fumes, even
                        <lb/>as a bird is caryed by the aire, when it flyes: now from fumes or winds, (which
                        <lb/>are nothing els but aire moves) coagulated is produced water, from which mixed
                        <lb/>with earth doe proceed all mineralls and metalls: yea these very things are
                        <lb/>determined to consist and be imediately coagulates of fumes: whether
                        <lb/>therefore it be ascribed to water or fume, the thing is the same, because
                        <lb/>they are both the matter of wind: the same may be sayd of mineralls
                        <lb/>and metalls, though more remotely: now the question is, who hee is, what
                        <lb/>ought to be carryd by wind! I answer, Chymically, it is Sulphur, which is
                        <lb/>carryd in Argent vive, as Lully in his booke, Chapt 32 attest, and alle the <note place="margin">Lully there. <lb/>The wind carryd <lb/>him in his belly, that <lb/>is, Sulphur is carryd <lb/>in <!-- need to insert chymical symbol somehow -->. and Chap. 47 <lb/>The Stone is fire <lb/>carryd in the belly <lb/>of aire</note>
                        <lb/>rest: physically, it is an infant, which ought in a little time to be borne into
                        <lb/>the world: I say allso Arithmetically, that it is the root of a Cube; Musically,
                        <lb/>that it is the Disdiapason; Geometrically, that it is a punctum the begining
                        <lb/>of a running line; Astronomically, the center of the planets, Saturne,
                        <lb/>Jupiter, and Mars: though these be different subjects, yet if they be
                        <lb/>well compard together, they will easily demonstrate the offspring of wind,
                        <lb/>which must be left to everymans industry more or lesse. But I indigitate
                        <lb/>the matter more plainly thus: every Mercury is compounded of fumes, 
                        <lb/>that is, of water elevating earth with it into an airy rarity, and of earth
                        <lb/>forcing aire to returne into a watry earth or earthy water: for the Ele=

                        <lb/>into a viscous nature, they doe not easily recede one from the other; but <!-- numbers above several words in next line -->
                        <lb/>either the volatile doe follow above, or remayne below with the fixes, the
                        <lb/>first whereof is evident in comon Mercury, the other in the philosophicall
                        <lb/>and fixes metalls: in these the fixes Elements doe predominate the volatile,
                        <lb/>in that the volatile oversway the fixes: nor indeed is it without reason, that 
                        <lb/>Mercury is calld and reputed the mossenger, interpreter, and as it were the
                        <lb/>running intermediate minister of the other Gods, with wings fitted to his
                        <lb/>head and feet: for hee is windy, and flyes through the aire as wind itselfe,
                        <lb/>as is comonly <!-- is is putting something consistly above the second o in comon? -->and really confirmes to the damage of many men; but car=

                        <lb/>things, hee exquisitely repraesents the philosophicall Mercury. Mercury there=

                        <lb/>may be matured; and the Embryo is Sulphur, which is infused into
                        <lb/>the belly of Boreas by the caelestialle Sunne, that hee may bring it
                        <lb/>forth being matured, who in the compleat time of his cariage produceth
