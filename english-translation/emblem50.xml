                        <lb/>are contrary, and appointed by the Philosophers to be joynd together,
                        <lb/>that one may act upon the other: But by the woman others meane, as
                        <lb/>Basill in Key 2d. sayth: For it is not convenient or comodious for an<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Eagle to place her nest upon the Alps, because her chickens would dye
                        <lb/>through the coldnesse of the Snow at the top of the mountains: But
                        <lb/>if you add to the Eagle a cold Dragon, which hath had his habitation
                        <lb/>a long time in the rocks, and crept out of the caves of the earth,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>and put them both into an infernall sell, then will Pluto blow a<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>blast, and draw a volatile fiery spirit out of the cold dragon, which
                        <lb/>with its great heat will burne the Eagles feathers, and excite such a
                        <lb/>sudorificke bath, as to melt the Snow at the top of the mountains,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>and turne it into water; from which a minerable bath may be well<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>præpared, contributing fortune and health to the King. Admirable in
                        <lb break="no"/>deed it is, that a cold dragon should yeild a fiery Spirit; yet experience<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>declares it to be true in burned serpents, which doe send forth a venomous<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb break="no"/>micall treasures called flammivomous dragons, as the keepers of the golden
                        <lb/>fleece, the Hesperian gardens, Cadmus, and the like. But this dragon lives
                        <lb/>in streight places of subterranean rocks, which you must there take, and
                        <lb/>joyne to the Eagle or woman, to her, in the grave, to the other, if you<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>had rather, in the nest: For the nature of a dragon is sometimes to lye in
                        <lb/>waite for the Eagles eggs, and wage mortall warre with the Eagle: Some
                        <lb/>there are of the Græcian writers who affirme that a dragon in times past<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>fell in love with a mayd and lay with her. What wonder therefore, if
                        <lb/>the Philosophers would have their dragon shutt up in a caverne with a<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>woman? Greverus joynes red and blacke dragons together in the deep<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>gulfe of the mountaine, and burnes them with fire, and the blacke pe
                        <lb break="no"/>rishing, hee sayth that the keeper of the mountaine searcheth for them
                        <lb/>every where, and brings them to the mountaine. Merlin in his vision (if it
                        <lb/>be not suppositious) makes mention of a white and red dragon; These
                        <lb/>Dragons, whatsoever they be, whether one be a woman, or a female<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>dragon, doe act one with the other, till they both dye, and emitt blood
                        <lb/>from their wounds, wherewith they are embrued. But here the element
                        <lb/>of earth and fire is understood by the dragon, and by the woman the
                        <lb/>element of aire and water; whereupon sayth Clangor buccinæ: The Dragon
                        <lb/>is the matter remaining in the bottome after the water be distilld from
                        <lb/>it: And according to Hermes: The water of aire being between heaven and
                        <lb/>earth is the life of every thing, for that water dissolves a body into a<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb break="no"/>man: For it conferrs the whole benefitt of the art: Of the earth allso hee thus
                        <lb/>speaks. And moreover understand, that the particular earth, which wee tread
                        <lb/>upon, is not the true element, yea is elemented with its true fifth element: Nor
                        <lb/>doth the fifth elementall substance recede from its elemented body, of which
                        <lb/>the earth is formed. And a little after. But the Virgin and true element,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>which fire cannot burne, is in the center of the earth: This is the dragon,
                        <lb/>whereof wee speake, insinuating itselfe even into the center of the earth,
                        <lb/>where the heat being great, it conceives within itselfe a flaming heat, where
                        <lb break="no"/>with it burnes the woman or eagle. The woman or eagle is indeed an airy<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>water, which some call the white or cælestiall eagle, and will have it made

                        <lb break="no"/>taine men blind in this art, faigning themselves to be quicksighted; But<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>sayth Count Bernhard in his Epistle, I tell you truely, that noe water dissolves
                        <lb/>a metallicke species by naturall reduction, except that which continues with<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>it in matter and forme, and which the metalls themselves can recongeale:<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>And a little after: Nor doth that water appertaine to bodyes in solutions, which
                        <lb/>remains not with them in congelations: And a little after: I tell you truely,
                        <lb/>that the oyle which naturally incerates and joyns natures together, and natu
                        <lb break="no"/>rally introduceth a Medicine for the tinging of other bodyes, is not compounded
                        <lb/>of any other extraneous thing, but onely of the bowells of the body which is
                        <lb/>to be dissolved: This therefore being apprehended, the eagle and woman, as
                        <lb/>allso the Dragon with the secrets of allmost the whole art are understood,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>which perhaps wee have thus farre too openly explained and declared to
