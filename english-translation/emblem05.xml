                        <lb/>the offspring, and be subject to the mans comand: for as shee sustaines and

                        <lb/>being brought forth with milke. To this end Nature hath praepared for the
                        <lb/>tender infant a digestible and proportioned food in the mothers breasts, which
                        <lb/>waits his coming, as the first provision and viaticum in this race of the world:
                        <lb/>by milke therefore hee is nourished, growes, and is increased, till hee be furnished
                        <lb/>with instruments to chaw bread, that is, teeth, then is hee deservedly weaned, be
                        <lb break="no"/>cause nature hath provided him other nutriment more solid: But here the phi
                        <lb break="no"/>losophers say, that a Toad must be put to the womans breasts, that shee may
                        <lb/>nourish it, as an infant, with her milke: This is a miserable and horrible spectacle,
                        <lb/>yea and a wicked thing, that milke designed for an infant should be given to a
                        <lb/>Toad, being a venomous beast, and contrary to the nature of man: Wee have
                        <lb/>heard and read of Serpents and Dragons sucking the teats of cowes: Toads might
                        <lb/>perhaps desire the same thing, if ocasion should be offered in beasts. There is a 
                        <lb/>noted story of a Toad, who seated himselfe upon the mouth, and inside of the
                        <lb/>lipps of a certaine countryman being asleep, soe that hee could not be driven of
                        <lb/>by any contrivance, unlesse by violence, which being accompanys with danger of
                        <lb/>death, by the spitting of poyson (which hee is sayd to use for defensive or offensive
                        <lb/>weapons) was therefore not to be attempted; but a remedy being found for the
                        <lb/>miserable man by antipathy, namely, of a very great Spider and the Toad,
                        <lb/>who hate one another mortally, hee was therefore carryd with the Toad di
                        <lb break="no"/>rectly to the place, where an <subst><del>overcome</del><add>overgrowne</add></subst>Spider has made its webs, which
                        <lb/>seing the Toad, praesently came downe upon the backe of the Toad, and
                        <lb/>prickd him with its sting: but hee having received noe harme thereby, it
                        <lb/>descended a second time, and strucke him againe more strongly, where
                        <lb break="no"/>upon the Toad began imediately to swell, and fell downe dead from the
                        <lb/>mans mouth, without any hurt to him. But here a thing contrary happens, be
                        <lb break="no"/>cause the Toad seireth not the mouth but the breast of the woman, by whose milke hee
                        <lb/>increaseth soe as to be of great magnitude and strength, but the woman consumes
                        <lb/>and dyes her spirits being taken away: for poyson is easily comunicates by the pec
                        <lb break="no"/>torall veins to the heart, and corrupts and destroyes it, as it is evident in the case of
                        <lb/>Cleopatra, who applyes Vipers to her breasts, being willing to be praevented by vo<note place="margin">Theophilus in<lb/>Turba makes men<lb break="no"/>tion of a Dragon<lb/>joynd to a woman</note>

                        <lb break="no"/>querours: But lest any man should thinke the philosophers soe cruell, as to en
                        <lb break="no"/>joyne a venomous reptile to be put to a woman, hee must know that this Toad
                        <lb/>is the offspring or sonne of the same woman, produced by a monstrous birth,
                        <lb/>and therefore by naturall right ought to be fed and nourished by the mothers
                        <lb/>milke, but it is not in the will of the sonne that the mother should dye: for
                        <lb/>neither could hee infect his mother, who was coagulated in her bowells, and
                        <lb/> increases by blood even to birth. It is indeed a thing ominous for a Toad
                        <lb/>to be borne of a woman, which in our knowledge hath happened elswhere:

                        <lb/>Guilielmus Novobrigensis, an English writer, in his comentaryes sayth (how
                        <lb/>truely let others judge) that in a certaine stone=quarry in the Diocesse of the
                        <lb/>Bishop of Winchester, a great stone being divided, there was within found a living
                        <lb/>Toad with a golden chaine, and it was by the Bishops comand hidden in the
                        <lb/>same place, and buryd in perpetuall darknesse, lest it might bear an ill omen
                        <lb/>with it: such is allso this Toad: for it is apparelled with gold, though not extrin
                        <lb break="no"/>secally, with the artificiall worke of a chaine, yet intrisecally with a naturall,
                        <lb/>namely of a stone, which some call Borax, Chelonitis, Batrachites, Crapaudina,
                        <lb/>or Garatronium: for this farre excells gold in virtue against all poysons whatsoe
                        <lb break="no"/>ver of animalls, and is comonly sett in gold, as a case or cover, that it may
                        <lb/>not be hurt or lost. But it ought to be legitimate <add>being</add> had out of <subst><del>the</del><add>an</add></subst>animall, but if
                        <lb/>it be pickd out of subterranean trenches, as comonly it is, the stone taken up
                        <lb/>may be made neat in the forme of it, and uses instead thereof with the best
                        <lb/>mineralls, releiving and comforting the heart: for <add>here</add> in <del>these</del><add>is</add> the philosophicall
                        <lb/>Toad <subst><del>is indeed</del><add>really</add></subst> found, not in a stone=quarry (as that fabler affirms) and hath
                        <lb/>gold in him, not outwardly for pompe: for to what end should a Toad adorne
                        <lb/>himselfe, lurking in darkenesse and secret places?  that hee might perhaps
                        <lb/>be magnificently saluted by a Beetle, if it mett him in the twylight? what
                        <lb/>subterranean Goldsmith should make him a golden chayne? the father
                        <lb/>perhaps of the green boyes, which came out of the land of St Martin, yea
                        <lb/>out of the earth itselfe, as allso two doggs out of the stone=quarry, asserted
                        <lb/>by the same Author?
