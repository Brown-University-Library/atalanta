                        <lb/>being brought forth with milke. To this end Nature hath praepared for the
                        <lb/>tender infant a digestible and proportioned food in the mothers breasts, which
                        <lb/>waits his coming, as the first provision and viaticum in this race of the world:
                        <lb/>by milke therefore hee is nourished, growes, and is increased, till hee be furnished
                        <lb/>with instruments to chaw bread, that is, teeth, then is hee deservedly weaned, be
                        <lb break="no"/>cause nature hath provided him other nutriment more solid: But here the phi
                        <lb break="no"/>losophers say, that a Toad must be put to the womans breasts, that shee may
                        <lb/>nourish it, as an infant, with her milke: This is a miserable and horrible spectacle,
                        <lb/>yea and a wicked thing, that milke designed for an infant should be given to a
                        <lb/>Toad, being a venomous beast, and contrary to the nature of man: Wee have
                        <lb/>heard and read of Serpents and Dragons sucking the teats of cowes: Toads might
                        <lb/>perhaps desire the same thing, if ocasion should be offered in beasts. There is a 
                        <lb/>noted story of a Toad, who seated himselfe upon the mouth, and inside of the
                        <lb/>lipps of a certaine countryman being asleep, soe that hee could not be driven of
                        <lb/>by any contrivance, unlesse by violence, which being accompanys with danger of
                        <lb/>death, by the spitting of poyson (which hee is sayd to use for defensive or offensive
                        <lb/>weapons) was therefore not to be attempted; but a remedy being found for the
                        <lb/>miserable man by antipathy, namely, of a very great Spider and the Toad,
                        <lb/>who hate one another mortally, hee was therefore carryd with the Toad di
                        <lb break="no"/>rectly to the place, where an <subst><del>overcome</del><add>overgrowne</add></subst>Spider has made its webs, which
                        <lb/>seing the Toad, praesently came downe upon the backe of the Toad, and
                        <lb/>prickd him with its sting: but hee having received noe harme thereby, it
                        <lb/>descended a second time, and strucke him againe more strongly, where
                        <lb break="no"/>upon the Toad began imediately to swell, and fell downe dead from the
                        <lb/>mans mouth, without any hurt to him. But here a thing contrary happens, be
