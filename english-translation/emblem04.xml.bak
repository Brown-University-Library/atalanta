                  <lb/>Sisters: The Philosophers have another reason, why Sisters may marry
                  <lb/>brothers, namely the similitude of substance, that it may be <orig>joyned</orig> to<pc>-</pc>
                  <lb/>the like: but in this kind there are onely two like one another as to species,

                  <lb/>agree in love and <orig>fruitfullnesse</orig>, and the propagation of Children: for as
