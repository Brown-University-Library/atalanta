                  <lb/>husbandman, that is, men of divers functions, but here mentions the husbandman
                  <lb/>and physician first, because their worke are very conspicuous in the imitation,
                  <lb/>emendation, and perfection of nature: for they both take a naturall subject,
                  <lb/>in which they attending to art add some certaine things necessary being wanting,
                  <lb/>or allso remove those things which are superfluous: soe that the art of both may
                  <lb/>(as medicine by Hippocrates) be defined by the addition of defect, and subtract
                  <lb break="no"/>tion of superfluity: for what dos the husbandman more than add ploughing, ridging
                  <lb/>furrowing, harrowing, dunging or manuring, sowing, et. to land left by nature, that
                  <lb/>is, commit the increase and good successe to nature, which administreth the heat
                  <lb/>of the Sunne, and raine, and multiplyes the seeds by them, and promotes them to
                  <lb/>standing corne soon after to be reaped: in the meane time whilst the herbe is
                  <lb/>springing the husbandman weeds out thistles and all impediments, gashes
                  <lb/>the corne being ripe, takes away things superfluous from it being reaped, namely<!-- Change the value of n to "e" plus the number of the emblem (in two digits), followed by a hyphen and then a two-digit count of sentence -->
                  <lb/>straw, chaffe, and such other things: Soe allso a physician (as allso a Chymist in
                  <lb/>a different respect) teacheth how to praserve pr√¶sent health to many body, being
                  <lb/>wanting to recover it by severall remedyes, takes away the morbificke cause,
                  <lb/>cures the disease, assuageth symptoms, abates superfluous blood by opening

                  <lb/>nature a thousand ways by the works of the understanding and art; which
                  <lb/>being notorious, Chymicall things are rather to be considered by us: for Chy
                  <lb break="no"/>mistry doth first declare the operations of agriculture by its secret bounds
                  <lb/>and wayes of operating: Husbandmen have land, wherein to sow seed, soe allso
                  <lb/>the Chymists: they have dung wherewith to manure their ground, soe
                  <lb/>allso these, without which nothing could be done, nor any successe expected:
                  <lb/>They have seed, the multiplication of which they desire: if Chymists
                  <lb/>had not the like, they would (as Lully sayth) imitate the painter, that
                  <lb/>endeavoures to expresse the fate of a certaine man, whome hee had never
                  <lb/>seen, nor the image of him: Husbandmen expect raine, and heat of the
                  <lb/>Sunne, soe allso doe the Chymists truely administer heat convenient to
                  <lb/>their worke, and raine: I need say noe more: <note place="margin" n="X">X Chymistry is exactly parallell to agriculture, and its deputy,
                  <lb/>which in all things expresseth its offices, but under a most absolute alle

                  <lb break="no"/>duces Ceres, Triptolemus, Osiris, Dionysus, the golden Gods, as relating to Chy=
                  <lb break="no"/>mistry, teaching as it were men how to cast the seeds of fruits into their
                  <lb/>earth, showing tillage, with the propagation of vines, and use of wine,
                  <lb/>all which things the ignorant have interpreted to rusticall operations, but
                  <lb/>erroneously: for those things, which are absconded from the vulgar, and
                  <lb/>declares to the Learned under these veils of agriculture, are most abstruse
                  <lb/>mysteryes of nature: To this end say the philosophers that their gold must
                  <lb/>be sowed upon white foliated earth, as if they meant that the sowing of corne
                  <lb/>should be observed and imitated for example, which the author of the trea=
                  <lb break="no"/>tise of corne and Jodoc. Greverus have most excellently performed in their
                  <lb/>descriptions, for they have both most elegantly accomodated every operation of
                  <lb/>agriculture in the producing of corne to the semination of gold, or generation of

                  <lb/>the hincture: White earth, because sandy, yields little fruit to the countrymen, by
                  <lb/>whome that which is blacke and fatt is more desired, but the white principally
                  <lb/>conduceth to the philosophers, if it be foliated, that is well praepared, because
                  <lb/>they know how to enrich it with their dung, the other not at all: Now sowing is
                  <lb/>the propagation of the world, whereby that, which cannot long endure in an
                  <lb/>individuall, is caused to persist in the species: This is in man, animalls, and
                  <lb/>plants, in these hermaphroditically, in them under two distinct sexes: but in
                  <lb/>metalls farre otherwise: for in them a line is made of the flux of a point, a
                  <lb/>superficies of the flux of a line, a body of the flux of a superficies: But
                  <lb/>the starrs produced that point before the line, superficies, and body, because
                  <lb/>it is the principle of them all: Nature added the flux a long time after, that is,
                  <lb/>the caelestiall Sunne did in the earth generate a Sonne, whome Mercury comitted
                  <lb/>to Vulcan and Chiron to be educated, that is, to manuall artifice, to be instructed,
                  <lb/>even as they write of Achilles, who was held and hardened in fire by his mother
                  <lb/>Thetys: hee, amongst other things, Learned Musicke, and the art of playing on the <note place="margin">For this reason sayth <lb/>Ovid. Phyllirides <lb/>made the youth <lb/>Achilles an excellent <lb/>Harpe</note>
                  <lb/>Harp from Chiron: but Achilles being noe other than the philosphicall subject (
                  <lb/>whose Sonne was was pyrrhus with red haire, without which two Troy could not be
                  <lb/>taken and subdued, as wee have abundantly demonstrated in our Hieroglyphicks
                  <lb/>booke 6.) therefore doe wee not without reason touch (though cursorily) upon Musicke
                  <lb/>in this our worke, where wee describe Achilles, and his heroicke virtues and en=
                  <lb break="no"/>terprises: For if Musicke adorned soe great a Heroe, why may it not allso
                  <lb/>make this our worke more complete and acceptable: For the Angells sing (as the
                  <lb/>sacred scriptures attest<supplied>)</supplied>, the heavens sing, as Pythagoras affirmes, and, as the
                  <lb/>Psalmist sayth, declare the glory of God, the Muses and Apollo sing, as
                  <lb/>the poett, men even infants sing, birds sing, sheep and geese sing in
                  <lb/>musicall instruments, if therefore wee allso sing, there is reason for it
