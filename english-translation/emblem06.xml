                  <lb/><milestone unit="section" n="e06-01" />A City sayth plato subsiste not by physician and physician, but by physician and
                  <lb/>husbandman, that is, men of divers functions, but here mentions the husbandman
                  <lb/>and physician first, because their worke are very conspicuous in the imitation,
                  <lb/>emendation, and perfection of nature: for they both take a naturall subject,
                  <lb/>in which they attending to art add some certaine things necessary being wanting,
                  <lb/>or allso remove those things which are superfluous: soe that the art of both may
                  <lb/>(as medicine by Hippocrates) be defined by the addition of defect, and subtract
                  <lb break="no"/>tion of superfluity: for what dos the husbandman more than add ploughing, ridging
                  <lb/>furrowing, harrowing, dunging or manuring, sowing, et. to land left by nature, that
                  <lb/>is, commit the increase and good successe to nature, which administreth the heat
                  <lb/>of the Sunne, and raine, and multiplyes the seeds by them, and promotes them to
                  <lb/>standing corne soon after to be reaped: in the meane time whilst the herbe is
                  <lb/>springing the husbandman weeds out thistles and all impediments, gashes
                  <lb/>the corne being ripe, takes away things superfluous from it being reaped, namely<!-- Change the value of n to "e" plus the number of the emblem (in two digits), followed by a hyphen and then a two-digit count of sentence -->
                  <lb/>straw, chaffe, and such other things: Soe allso a physician (as allso a Chymist in
                  <lb/>a different respect)Teatheth how to praserve praesent health to many body, being
                  <lb/>wanting to recover it by severall remedyes, takes away the morbificke cause,
                  <lb/>cures the disease, assuageth symptoms, abates superfluous blood by opening
                  <lb/>a veyne, being wanting restores it by apointing good order of dyet, evacua

                  <lb/>nature a thousand ways by the works of the understanding and art; which
                  <lb/>being notorious, Chymicall things are rather to be considered by us: for Chy
                  <lb break="no"/>mistry doth first declare the operations of agriculture by its secret bounds
                  <lb/>and wayes of operating: Husbandman have land, wherein to sow seed, soe allso
                  <lb/>the Chymists: they have dung wherewith to manure their ground, soe
                  <lb/>allso these, without which nothing could be done, nor any successe expected:
                  <lb/>They have seed, the multiplication of which they desire: if Chymists
                  <lb/>had not the like, they would (as Lully sayth) imitate the painter, that
                  <lb/>endeavoures to expresse the fate of a certaine man, whome hee had never
                  <lb/>seen, nor the image of him: Husbandman expect raine, and heat of the
                  <lb/>Sunne, soe allso doe the Chymists truely administer heat convenient to
                  <lb/>their worke, and raine: I need say noe more: <note place="margin" n="X">X Chymistry is exactly parallell to agriculture, and its deputy,
                  <lb/>which in all things expreesseth its offices, but under a most absolute alle-
