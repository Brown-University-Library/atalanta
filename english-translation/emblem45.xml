                        <lb/>A shadow therefore and night is the privation or absence (as day on the<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>observed that their Sunne hath allso a blacke, cloudy, and flying Shadow:
                        <lb/>Hereupon Sayth Hermes, My Sonne! take from the ray its shadow, that is,

                        <lb/>which Vulcan is made overseer, that even that part of your Earth, which

                        <lb/>Sunne: for if the whole Firmament of the heaven with all things con

                        <lb/>circumvolved by the first motion, but the Sunne onely moved by its owne
                        <lb/>(calld the second and annuall) motion, it would happen that they, which
                        <lb/>are Antipodes below us, would for the Space of allmost six moneths have
                        <lb/>a night, and wee a day, and afterwards on the contrary they a day and<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>wee a night; soe that the whole year would consist of one night and<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>day, as now these courses are by experience and reason confirmed to be<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>most true under both the Poles: But it seemd farre otherwise to divine provi
                        <lb break="no"/>dence, which therefore hath ordained two motions of the Planets, the first
                        <lb/>and second, and soe distributed the year into many dayes: Now that sha

                        <lb/>without them that Science can scarce be perfected; Chymists doe allso ascribe

                        <lb/>without a shadow? As a clapper without a bell: That indeed makes the first
