                        <lb/>best of all describe the two stones, where hee sayth: That there are two<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>principall stones of this art, the white and the red of wonderfull nature: at
                        <lb/>the setting of the Sunne the white begins to appear upon the surface of the
                        <lb/>waters, hiding itselfe till midnight, and afterwards declines to the bottome: But
                        <lb/>the red operates contrariwise, it beginning to ascend upon the waters at the
                        <lb/>rising of the Sunne till noone, and then descends to the bottome. These<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Stones therefore are the aforesayd Eagles sent by Jupiter from Delphi;<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>These allso are the wolfe and dogge coming from different or opposite parts<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>of the earth, which bitt and werry'd one the other, and both became mad, as<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Rhasis in his epistle declares: These stones are the most true Bezoar,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>whereof the east Indyes send the best, drawne from the bowells of<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>comes from the East, Mercury from the Western tract, whereof this is
                        <lb/>gentle and tractable, that cholericke and angry; which two, when

                        <lb/>wolfe recovering strength afterwards overthrowes the dogge, and be

                        <lb/>strength, perforating bodyes when hee meets with them, and is white
                        <lb/>in apparition, red by experiment, and is the man which tooke Luna
                        <lb/>to wife, whome some men suppose to be gold of a most pretious con
                        <lb break="no"/>nexion and composition, whose congealed part is never dissolved, nor
                        <lb/>footsteps or impressions defaced, which God hath freely bestowed<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>upon the pious and elect Philosophers: You must know, that nature<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>hath gotten an æquall as an enemy. These are his words. And a little after
                        <lb/>hee sayth: That Sulphur is most strong, and fighting against fire<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>which it containes and is contained: for a most pretious colour proceeds
                        <lb/>from them being joynd together, and that Sulphur, which is naturally
                        <lb/>volatile, can never afterwards flye away, because the Soule hath<pc>--</pc>

                        <lb/>perforated it, in like manner the tincture of the Soule hath both perforated
                        <lb/>and is mixed with the body, and the body hath contained the soule, and
                        <lb/>restrained the naturall part from flying. And then to one demanding which
                        <lb/>of the stones was strongest, hee answers: That stone which is noe stone
                        <lb/>is stronger than the other enemy: but the red is stronger than that<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>which strengthened its companions by its fortitude. The Orientall wolfe is
                        <lb/>therefore stronger than the Occidentall dogge, though hee obtaine not the
                        <lb/>victory effectually, but perisheth together with the enemy: but the tinging
                        <lb/>poyson is producd from both: The differente between a wolfe and dogge is
                        <lb/>small, a Mastive or great dogge representing the forme and shape of a
                        <lb/>wolfe, soe as to seeme a wolfe originally, but made tame by long progene
                        <lb break="no"/>ration: After the same manner Sulphur and Mercury doe little differ one
                        <lb/>from the other, because that proceeds from this, or this from that: Mercury
                        <lb/>did indeed begett Sulphur, but Sulphur purged Mercury and made it soe:
                        <lb/>Concerning these the same Rosinus, the quæstion being asked, from<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>whence comes its colour? answers, from the most intense bitternesse of it:
                        <lb/>and againe. From whence comes its bitternesse and intension? hee answers
                        <lb/>from the impurity of its metall: And againe: Is its red colour never su
                        <lb break="no"/>pereminent? hee answers, Yes: And againe: Is it allso never hotter than<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>fire? hee answer; Fire in respect of it is as water in respect of fire: And
                        <lb/>againe: Is it not stronger than fire? hee answers, not. And againe: Why<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>therefore doe you affirme it to be stronger than fire? hee answers, because
                        <lb/>fires meeting together doe one destroy the other. It is therefore manifest<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>that one becomes the food and aliment of the other, and soe much as one
                        <lb/>decreaseth, soe much the other increaseth, till that which increaseth præ
                        <lb break="no"/>vayles, and the Dragon devoures the serpent: In great fights it often times
                        <lb/>happens, that they that undergoe the greater slaughter doe winne the
                        <lb/>feild and victory; Soe allso though the dogge lay prostrate, yet was not<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>alltogether overcome, hee holding his enemy soe fast, that hee could not
                        <lb/>line without him, nor hee dye without the other<pc>. . . . . . .</pc>
