                        <lb/>is, that nature is guided, taught, governed, subdued and overcome by nature, as
                        <lb/>a young Scholar by a Mistresse, a waiting mayd by her Lady, a subject by a
                        <lb/>Queen, yea a daughter by the mother, and kinswoman by kinswoman: how
                        <lb/>true it is, appears by dayly experience, in the education of youth amongst
                        <lb/>men, and other actions, as literary discipline or institution, government, and
                        <lb/>the like. Pliny writes of the Nightingalls, that one teacheth, attends, observes,
                        <lb/>imitates, overcomes another in singing, or being overcome greives, and that
                        <lb/>sometimes being outdone and vanquished in the conflict, the throat being broken,
                        <lb/>it perisheth, and in the midle of singing falls downe dead: Wee see allso how
                        <lb/>all sorts of birds doe begin to accustome and instruct their young being yet
                        <lb/>unfeathered and tender for flying, that not onely nature, but allso art or
                        <lb/>use hath begotten in them the habit of flying, though nature alone gave
                        <lb/>power and organs to exercise that action, without which neither institution
                        <lb/>or art can find foundation or place: soe colts are taught to runne by the
                        <lb/>mare, whelps to barke by the bitch, and young foxes to craft by the
                        <lb/>dam, nor is there any animated and sensitive nature or species of na
                        <lb break="no"/>ture found, which guides, instructs, and governs not another nature, as its
                        <lb/>minor, or suffers itselfe to be overcome by another, as a parent: Wee doe
                        <lb/>not perceive such discipline in vegetables, yet notwithstanding the use is
                        <lb/>observed in them, and that mens hands are of much efficacy: for whilst
                        <lb/>corne is in the blade, it may be cleansed from incommodious thistles and
                        <lb/>tares, whilst a tree is yet a twig it may be bent, and made to grow as
                        <lb/>you please: Soe in metalls and Philosophicall subjects one nature keeps,
                        <lb/>praeserves, and defends another nature in fire, as is knowne to founders and
                        <lb/>testers, but especially to the masters of naturall things: Iron is very helpfull
                        <lb/>and as a midwife to Silver and gold being yet very tender and Spirituall,
                        <lb/>as they call it, mixd in its mynes with Cadmia, Arsenicke, or Antimony
                        <lb/>the cheife, if it be cast into mynes to be burnd in a fire of furnaces:
                        <lb/>after the same manner iron itselfe, if it be intended to be changed into
                        <lb/>Steele, is saved from burning by white stones found at the Sea Shoares;
                        <lb/>Some doe cast the powders of crystall glasse, or the gall of glasse upon
                        <lb/>metallicke powders which are to be dissolved, that they may not pe
                        <lb break="no"/>rish by over much fire: Instead of this gall of glasse the Philosophers
                        <lb/>doe use their Eudica, which Morienus sas is allso the gall of glasse,
                        <lb/>and to be had in glasse vessells: for the heat of fire consumes the body
                        <lb/>with hasty burning: but Eudica applyed will free bodyes changed into
                        <lb/>earth from any burning: For bodyes, when now they doe not retaine
                        <lb/>their soules, are soon burned: Eudica (the faex of glasse) is indeed very
                        <lb/>agreable to all bodyes, for it vivifyes and praepares them, and defends
                        <lb/>them from all burning: These are the sayings of Morienus the Roman:
                        <lb/>This therefore is the nature, which teacheth another nature to resist
                        <lb/>fire, and be enured to it, which is the Mistresse instructing the

                        <lb/>the subject, and which is the daughter nobilitating and dignifying the mother;
                        <lb/>This is that red servant, which is joynd in matrimony with his odoriferous
                        <lb/>mother, and of her begets a progeny farre more noble than the parents
                        <lb/>thereof: This is Pyrrhus the Sonne of Achilles, and the young man with
                        <lb/>red haire, golden vestment, blacke eyes, white feet: This is the knight

                        <lb break="no"/>gon, to rescue out of his jawes the pure and unviolated virgin Albifica,
                        <lb/>sirnamed Beja, or Blanca: This is the monster=killing Hercules, who
                        <lb/>delivered from the monster Hesione the daughter of Laomedon being
                        <lb/>exposed to a terible and cruell Whale: This is that Perseus, who de
                        <lb break="no"/>fended (released, and marryed) Andromeda, the daughter of Cassiope
                        <lb/>and Cepheus King of Aethiopia, from the Sea monster, Shewing the
                        <lb/>head of Medusa: This is hee that may be compared with those ancient Ro
                        <lb break="no"/>mans the praeservers and refiners of the people, Marcus Curtius, Lucius Scae
                        <lb break="no"/>vola, Horatius Cocles, Manlius Capitolinus, and the like, to rescue the
                        <lb/>Citty, as it were the mother, from dangers: For this is the way and forme
                        <lb/>of nature tending to the perfection of any worke, to bring one thing out
                        <lb/>of another, a thing more perfect out of a thing imperfect, and reduce
                        <lb/>power into action, but not perfect all things in a moment, but one thing
                        <lb/>after another: Nor this alone, but shee constitutes allso her deputy in the
                        <lb/>first place, to which Shee leaves the power of life and death, that is, of
                        <lb/>forming other things, as for example, in the generation of man Shee
                        <lb/>useth a long processe, as of tenne moneths, where first attending to the
                        <lb/>opinion of Aristotle, Shee fabricates the heart, as the vicar deputy, or
                        <lb/>principall bowell, and then the heart delineates, formes, and perfects
                        <lb/>the other parts necessary to nutrition, the life, senses, and generative
                        <lb/>power, and comunicates to them life and vivificke spirits by Systole
                        <lb/>and diastole, or dilatation and compression of the arteryes, soe long
                        <lb/>as it is not impeded by diseases and violence: And thus one nature
                        <lb/>teacheth another, which you must observe and follow for an example
                        <lb/>of the Philosophicall worke, as a thing most clear and evident
