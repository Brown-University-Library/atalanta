                        <lb/>three hundred and sixty five children, which were all baptized,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>and the males called by the name of John, and the females Eliza

                        <lb break="no"/>dune, one mile distant from the Hague towards the Sea in Holland,

                        <lb/>inscription of the story: The cause alleadyd was, that the Countesse,
                        <lb/>seing a poor woman carry two children twinns in her armes, calld her
                        <lb/>adulteresse, as if it was impossible for more children to be borne at one
                        <lb/>conception by one man, but necessarily by severall: Whereupon an im

                        <lb/>of that accusation, the Countesse conceived in her wombe at one time
                        <lb/>and by one man soe many children, as there are dayes in the year:
                        <lb/>This is indeed a miracle, but a naturall worke, which happened<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>through the vengeance of God: But in the Philosophicall worke<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>that, which is otherwise contrary to nature, is easily admitted under
                        <lb/>the veyle of an allegory: For here one infant is sayd to have three fa
                        <lb break="no"/>thers, or allso two, as allso mothers: Hereupon sayth Raymund cited by the<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Rosary; Our infant hath two fathers and two mothers, and because hee
                        <lb/>with his whole substance is tenderly nourished in fire, hee therefore<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>never dyes: Soe Dionysus or Bacchus is sayd to have two mothers, who<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>was rip'd out of his mothers belly (being burned) before the time of his
