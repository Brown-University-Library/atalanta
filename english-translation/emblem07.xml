                        <lb/>various diseases, could not arise, that wee perceive to be true of the elements
                        <lb/>of the world: for if there was but one onely element, there could be noe
                        <lb/>mutation of it into another, noe generation nor corruption, yea all things
                        <lb/>would be one immutable thing, and noe meteors, mineralls, plants, and
                        <lb/>animalls could be naturally from theme produced. For this reason the su

                        <lb/>contrary natures, namely of light and heavy, hott and cold, moist and dry
                        <lb/>that one might be affinity passe into the other, and soe acomposition be
                        <lb/>made of bodyes, which might be very different one from another in essence,
                        <lb/>qualityes, virtues, and effects: for in things perfectly mixed are the light Ele
                        <lb break="no"/>ments, as fire and aire, and allso the heavy, as earth and water, which are soe
                        <lb/>aequally tempered together, that one recedes not from the other, but suffers itselfe
                        <lb/>to be easily taken and held by the other as neighbour by neighbour: Earth and aire
                        <lb/>are contrary one to the other, soe fire and water, yea notwithstanding fire main
                        <lb break="no"/>taines freindship with aire by heat comon to both, with earth by siccity: soe
                        <lb/>aire with water, and water with earth: by which means they are all joyned
                        <lb/>by bonds of affinity or rather consanguinity, and doe remayne together in
                        <lb/>one composition, which, if it abound with the light Elements, elevates the
                        <lb/>heavy with it, if with the heavy, weighs downe the light with it: This is decla
                        <lb break="no"/>red by the two Eagles, one with wings, the other without, of which that
                        <lb/>which endeavoured to fly is restrained by the <add>other</add> an example hereof is evident
                        <lb/>in the fight of the Falcon and Heron, for the Falcon soaring higher in
                        <lb/>the aire by his speedy flying, takes and tears the Heron with his Talons, by
                        <lb/>whose weight both fall to the ground: The contrary appeared in the
                        <lb/>artificiall dove or Automa of Archytas, where heavy things were lifted up
                        <lb/>by light, that is, the wooden body of it caryed into the aire by the
                        <lb/>spirit includes within: In the philosophicall subject the light things doe
                        <lb/>first praedominate the heavy, as to plenty, but they are overcome by vir
                        <lb break="no"/>tue of the heavy things, and in processe of time the Eagles wings are cut
                        <lb/>of, and one very great bird (namely an Ostrich) is made of two, which
                        <lb/>can consume iron, and which being impeded by weight runns more upon
                        <lb/>the earth, than flyes in the aire, though it hath goodly wings: Concerning
                        <lb/>this or the like Hermes (as the Author of Aurora chapt. 5. affirms) writes thus:
                        <lb/>I have considered a bird worthy to be had in estimation by the wise, which
                        <lb/>flyes when it is in Aries, Cancer, Libra, or Capricorne, and you will never
                        <lb/>fayle of it in pure mynes, and rocky mountains: Concerning the same Se
                        <lb break="no"/>nior in Tabula, where two are soon, one volatile the other without wings,
                        <lb/>whereof one holds the others tayle by its beake, that they cannot easily be
                        <lb/>seperated: For this is the device and machination of universall nature,
                        <lb/>allwayes to rayse heavy things by light, and likewise to depresse light
                        <lb/>things by heavy, as the Author of the perfect Magistery declareth, who
                        <lb/>constitutes seven minerall spirits, as it were erraticke starrs, and

                        <lb/>soe many metallicke bodyes, as fixed starrs, and enjoyns these to be
                        <lb/>wedded to those: from theme allso Aristotle the Chymist, the spirit, sayth hee,
                        <lb/>having dissolved the body and soule, soe as to exist in their forme, doth not
                        <lb/>remaine a fixed thing, unlesse you operate upon it: now operation is to joyne
                        <lb/>it with the body, from which you praepared it at first: because the spirit is
                        <lb/>thereby prevented from flight being mixed with the supersistences of the
                        <lb/>body: the light Elements, namely aire and fire, as a learned man declares,
                        <lb/>doe in Camphore oversway the heavy; and therefore it is sayd wholy to ex
                        <lb break="no"/>hale and evaporate into aire. In Argent vive, the flowers of Sulphur, Anti
                        <lb break="no"/>mony, the salt of Harts blood, Sal Armoniacke, and such others, the earth
                        <lb/>flyes with the aire into the Alembicke, and is not seperated from it. In Gold,
                        <lb/>glasse, Diamond, the stone Smyris, Granats, and the like, the Elements
                        <lb/>doe notwithstanding fire remayne along time joyned without detriment,
                        <lb/>and the earth retaines those things which are left in itselfe. In other com
                        <lb break="no"/>bustibles division and separation of one thing from another is effected, soe
                        <lb/>that the ashes are left in the bottome, the water, aire, and fire fly up
                        <lb break="no"/>wards: wee must not therefore have respect to the unaequall composition of
                        <lb/>these last, being not soe strongly mixd, nor to the comixtion of the first,
                        <lb/>though more durable, yet volatile, but to the solidity, constancy, and fixity
                        <lb/>of the midle: for soe the bird without wings will detaine that which hath,
                        <lb/>and the fixed substance will fix the volatile, which must necessarily be
