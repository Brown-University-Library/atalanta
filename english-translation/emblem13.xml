                        <lb break="no"/>prosy by that washing, is a miracle of divine omnipotence: For the Leprosy,
                        <lb/>which being seated in the blood, and radicall parts of mans body, is as it were
                        <lb/>an universall Canker, cannot be cured or taken away by any externall
                        <lb/>washings, much lesse of cold water, such as was of Jordan. After the same
                        <lb/>manner that the Philosophers brasse diseased with an Hydropsy, should be
                        <lb/>freed from it by the washings of water, yea that being imperfect it should be
                        <lb/>reduced to perfection, and being sicke to health, soe as to be able to comunicate
                        <lb/>the same to other sicke bodyes, is next to a miracle: For such an example is
                        <lb/>not elswhere extant in nature, nor is it the ordinary way of nature to pro
                        <lb break="no"/>duce the Philosophers most absolute tincture, unlesse it be governed by art,
                        <lb/>and fitt subjects administred to it with the externall efficient. Soe the resti

                        <lb/>the infant may thereby have egresse, as by a door, and herein the most great
                        <lb/>and mercifull God operates by nature above nature: Soe that the stone
                        <lb/>should be perfected, may seeme to be a thing supernaturall, though really
                        <lb/>it is naturall: Wherefore sayth a Philosopher in the Rosary, You must know
                        <lb/>that our stone is airy and volatile, externally cold and moist, internally
                        <lb/>hott and dry: and that coldnesse and moisture which is externall, is a watry
                        <lb/>fume, corrupting, blacking, and destroying itselfe and all things, and flyes
                        <lb/>from fire: and that heat and siccity which is internall, is gold hott and dry,
                        <lb/>and is a most pure oyle, penetrating bodyes, and is not fugitive, because the
                        <lb/>heat and siccity of Alchymy tingeth, and nothing els: Cause therefore the
                        <lb/>externall, coldnesse and watry moisture, to be like to the internall heat and
                        <lb/>siccity, soe that they may agree and be united together, and all at once be
                        <lb break="no"/>made one penetrating, tinging, and fixing body: but these moistures must be
                        <lb/>destroyd by fire, and degrees of fire with soft temperament, and a congruous
                        <lb/>and moderate digestion: These there: But if true, how can it be freed from
                        <lb/>water by water? but it may be answered, that some certaine waters are
                        <lb/>hott and dry in quality, such as are many baths, in which it must be Phi
                        <lb break="no"/>losophically washed: For this is that which they say, wash with fire, and
                        <lb/>burne with water; for that fire, which washeth, and that water, which bur
                        <lb break="no"/>neth, differ one from the other in name onely, but agree in effect and ope
                        <lb break="no"/>ration: That brasse therefore must be washd, that is, dryed from its super
                        <lb break="no"/>fluous moistures by this water, or this fire: Wee have knowne experiments
                        <lb/>of Hydropicall bodyes cured by six moneths absence from any drinke,
                        <lb/>by being buryed in hott sand, or Cowes dung, by being put in a a hott fur
                        <lb break="no"/>nace, and sweating, and innumerable other helps, yea allso by drying
                        <lb/>baths, such as are at Carolina and Wisbadenses not farre from Mentz:
                        <lb/>By the same wayes must this Patient be cured, sometimes by waters,

                        <lb/>sometimes by the hott aire of furnaces, sometimes by dung, sometimes sand,
                        <lb/>and by abstaining from drinke: for these are most effectuall remedyes in both
                        <lb/>cases, here and there to be used: but in all these things heat is the operator,
                        <lb/>which drawes forth and consumes the superfluous water by the Emunctoryes
                        <lb/>or allso pores of the body: For externall heat quickens the internall, that is,
                        <lb/>the vitall Spirits, to expell that moisture which is noxious to it, as an unpro
                        <lb break="no"/>fitable excrement, by which the naturall heat was before suppressd as by
                        <lb/>an enemy: In this cure there is need of great diligence and praecaution,
                        <lb/>lest whilst one bowell is helpd, another be hurt: In a Quartan (the Plato
                        <lb break="no"/>micke probation of a Physician) wee find, that thicke and viscous humors,
                        <lb/>like the gumme or glew of trees, being gathered together from all the veins
                        <lb/>and masse of blood, doe descend through the hollow or great veins even to the
                        <lb/>bottome of the backe, where obstructing the emulgent veins, which draw
                        <lb/>the serous humor out of the blood, or the passages of them, they are lesse
                        <lb/>able to operate, and more serous liquor remaines in the body, and soe in
                        <lb/>a short time, if care be not taken, a Dropsy may happen, the other bowells
                        <lb/>being allso untainted at first: Diureticks doe here little or noe good, purgatives
                        <lb/>yet lesse, unlesse diminution and eduction be made in some certaine series of
                        <lb/>time: Sudorificks are allso manifestly hurtfull, because they draw out the more
                        <lb/>subtill parts, leaving the thicker, and being continued debilitate the body: for
                        <lb/>the custome of nature is to find that way to evacuate serosityes through the pores
                        <lb/>when shee is obstructed about the bladder: This therefore is Scylla, the other
                        <lb/>Charybdis, both which hee that has a mind to praeserve himselfe ought to
                        <lb/>avoyd: But that Dropsy which proceeds from an impaired Liver or Spleen,
                        <lb/>if it be confirmed, is of most difficult cure: Now in the Philosophicall
                        <lb/>brasse the cure is not impossible, the distemper being rather by accident,
                        <lb/>and secundary, than essentiall or primary, provided it be cautiously be
                        <lb break="no"/>gun, as wee have sayd concerning the plenty of serum in a Quartan, to
                        <lb/>witt, that it may not by overmuch exiccation fall into a consumption, or
                        <lb/>by humectation into a Dropsy difficult to be cured
