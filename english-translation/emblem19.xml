                        <lb/>with seven were chargd with as warders: and the same Geryon is reported to be
                        <lb/>the Sonne of Chrysaor sprung from the blood of Medusa, and that Dragon the
                        <lb/>Sonne of Typhon, and Echidna: which things agreing with noe hystory, or truth
                        <lb/>of the matter, as it sounds, and making a noyse in all Chymicall Allegoryes,
                        <lb/>they are not without added hereto by us: But by the three bodyes of Geryon wee
                        <lb/>meane three faces beheld in one father, according to the sense of Hermes, or as
                        <lb/>others would have it, foure, having regard to soe many Elements: For of a Qua
                        <lb break="no"/>drangle ought a triangle to be made, as that made of a circle, soe this to re
                        <lb break="no"/>turne into a cicle: And the consanguinity and naturall conjunction of the
                        <lb/>bodyes of Geryon, or the Elements is soe great, that one being overcome or
                        <lb/>killd, the rest allso dye of themselves and putrefy, without the administration
                        <lb/>of any manuall force: As to things with two bodyes it is knowne, that one being
                        <lb/>dead, the other allso wasts and consumes: as in Italy wee have seen a boy
                        <lb/>foure years of age with two bodyes, who absconded the head of his brother cleaving
                        <lb/>to him, within his owne body, the other parts hung downe to the navill, where
                        <lb/>they were bound or joynd together: But if hee, that hung downe, and being
                        <lb/>much lesse, was carryed by the other, Should be touchd about the hands or
                        <lb/>feet too hard, the bigger did hereby feele paine, yea allso hunger, if the lesse
                        <lb/>wanted food: And this is the combination and sympathy of nature, whereby
                        <lb/>the members and parts of one body, or joynd with another are mutually
                        <lb/>moved and affected together; whereof if one sound and unhurt, yet
                        <lb/>the other doe not thereby necessarily continue sound and unhurt, but if
                        <lb/>greivously hurt, the rest doe allso sympathize, and perish by the same
                        <lb/>malady: Soe if a neighbour gains much, noe profit thereby accrews to his
                        <lb/>neighbour, but if hee Suffers losse by fire, his neighbour receives much
                        <lb/>damage: for your affaires are in danger when your neighbours house hath
                        <lb/>taken fire: It is not therefore a thing contradictory to truth, for the other
                        <lb/>three to dye, by the destruction of one of these foure brethren, seing that
                        <lb/>it may happen divers wayes, either by finding the same ends as beginings
                        <lb/>of life being borne at one birth both by father and mother, as wee
                        <lb/>have read has happened to some, perhaps by the inclination of the
                        <lb/>starrs, or by being joyned together not onely in soules, but allso ligaments
                        <lb/>of the body, or by consternation of mind, by strong imagination in time
                        <lb/>of pestilence, or by the vow of a league: A certaine heathenish people
                        <lb/>livd by the name of Pythagoreans in the Indyes under the govern

                        <lb break="no"/>thren being dead, the other doe allso perish by fire, not compulsively, but
                        <lb/>voluntarily, that they may not survive in sorrow and infamy: or if one be
                        <lb/>assaulted with a club, sword, or stone, hee will commence civill warre with
                        <lb/>his brethren, as appears in the Gyants sprung from the teeth of a dragon
                        <lb/>opposing Jason, and elswhere allso Cadmus, and soe they will all fall by
                        <lb/>mutuall destruction: For touch or hurt him that carryes aire, and hee will
                        <lb/>insurge against those two together which are nearest to him, namely him
                        <lb/>that carryes water, and him that carryes fire, and these will on both sides
                        <lb/>oppose themselves agaynst him that carryes earth, and him that first promo

                        <lb/>which they dye: For it is thus decreed amongst the brethren, that the more
                        <lb/>earnestly and vehemently they love one another, if once they begin to hate,
                        <lb/>they are not to be reconciled, but pursue one another to death, as the most
                        <lb/>bitter choler is generated from the sweetest honey in a stomacke too hott, or the
                        <lb/>Liver being corrupted. Kill therefore him that is alive, but soe, as being dead
                        <lb/>to quicken him againe, otherwise the death of him killd avayles you nothing;
                        <lb/>for death will manifest him, that is to say, after resurrection, and death,
                        <lb/>darkenesse, and the sea will fly from him, as Hermes asserts, and the Dragon

                        <lb/>Rosary signifyes the same thing, saying: And let this be done, when you

                        <lb/>nature, you must then allso kill the natures, and wee are quickened by
                        <lb/>a new and spirituall resurrection, soe that afterwards wee cannot dye
