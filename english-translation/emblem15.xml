                        <lb/>round body, soe allso the Potters worke seems to be compounded of the
                        <lb/>same Elements particularly, namely of siccity and moisture, that one
                        <lb/>may regulate the other: for if the earth should be without water, nei
                        <lb break="no"/>ther the Ocean, sea, lakes, rivers, or fountains would be near the earth,
                        <lb/>it could bear nothing of itselfe, but remaine barren: Soe if water should
                        <lb/>not be received into the cavityes of the earth, but stand about, it would
                        <lb/>easily cover the whole earth, and soe the same remayne inhabitable:
                        <lb/>but one entring amicably into the other, and water moderating the
                        <lb/>siccity of the earth, the earth the moisture of that, by their mutuall
                        <lb/>comixtion, hereby is the fertility and utility of both Elements conspi
                        <lb break="no"/>cuous: In like manner the Potter mixeth clay with water, to make
                        <lb/>thereof a tractable masse, which hee Shapes by his wheele, and setts in
                        <lb/>the warme aire, that it may be gradually dryed; then adds violence of
                        <lb/>fire, that his vessells may be well hardened, and condensed into a durable
                        <lb/>stone, which can resist both water and fire: Soe allso must wee proceed
                        <lb/>in the naturall worke as the Philosophers attest, and therefore doe affirme
                        <lb/>that example ought to be taken from the potters. For as to siccity and
                        <lb/>moisture, that is, earth and water, wee doubt not that there is much
                        <lb/>affinity in both, but much difference in the way of coction, and in the
                        <lb/>matter and forme of compounding the Elements: For Potters vessells have
                        <lb/>an artificiall forme, the Philosophicall tincture a forme alltogether natu
                        <lb break="no"/>rall, and soe much more noble than they, by how much the more excel
                        <lb break="no"/>lent the matter of this is than theirs: either is indeed a worke of earth, but
                        <lb/>in the Philosophicall there is nothing sayd to be, which hath not ascended
                        <lb/>and attained to the heaven of aire, in that a thicke and faeculent earth is
                        <lb/>praedominant: The effect of both is a stone, there a comon, here a Philo
                        <lb break="no"/>sophicall: by which name a certaine person being seduced put a great
                        <lb/>number of artificiall stones or tyles into one chest, and the whiter sort
                        <lb/>of flints into another, using Diabolicall conjurations from above, by
                        <lb/>which the last were at a certaine time to be converted into silver, the
                        <lb/>first into pure gold: but they being supposed to be the Philosophers
                        <lb/>Stones, and therefore a great summe of mony accrewing to purchase se
                        <lb/>verall things, when the new gold and Silver might be expected, at a
                        <lb/>certaine time, in which it not appearing, nor the stones converted into
                        <lb/>gold, as was desired, death put an end to the folly and Shame: For gold
                        <lb/>or Silver ought not to be expected from that thing, in which it is not na
                        <lb break="no"/>turally, diabolicall Magicke having noe place in these divine works, but
                        <lb/>is as farre different from them, as the author of it from a devout and
                        <lb/>pious man, hell from heaven: Soe though it may be esteemed the true
                        <lb/>Philosophicall stone, yet let not any man perswade himselfe, that im
                        <lb break="no"/>possible things can performed by it, us Isaack admonisheth: noe man
                        <lb/>being bound either by the lawes of nature, or polity to things im

                        <lb break="no"/>possible: as for the transmutation of gemms by it, and performing the
                        <lb/>malleability of glasse any man thereby perceive, whether these
                        <lb/>things are possible, and congrous to this nature, or noe: Geber affirms
                        <lb/>that the Philosophers speake many things allegorically, as allso of him
                        <lb break="no"/>selfe, that where hee spoke clearly and plainly, hee sayd nothing, but
                        <lb/>where figuratively, there hee absconded the truth, as wheat under
                        <lb/>chaffe: Those things which a man sowes, the same allso will hee reap, which takes
                        <lb/>place in vegetables and animalls, though different species may sometimes proceed
                        <lb/>from the things sowed: whether these ought to be applyed to metalls,
                        <lb/>which are not propagated by seed, as those, must be considered: In these the
                        <lb/>parts onely are homogeneous, Sulphur, and Argent vive, in those they are hete
                        <lb break="no"/>rogeneous or organicke: In these are noe receptacles of seed, but in those:
                        <lb/>In these there is not found any nutrition, augmentation, or extension in all
                        <lb/>dimensions, in those very much: yea these are elemented weights admitting
                        <lb/>mixtion alone, those allso besides mixtion have either a vegetine or sensitive
                        <lb/>soule: Neverthelesse it is without doubt true that there is something in places
                        <lb/>under the earth, which is not gold now, but will after a thousand years be
                        <lb/>gold by nature: Who will deny this to be the analogicall seed of gold? both
                        <lb/>gold and the aurificke nature being of one originall and radix, though
                        <lb/>this of the more noble forme, and therefore the seed of gold being knowne,
                        <lb/>this allso will be manifested: The Philosophers affirme siccity and mois
                        <lb break="no"/>ture or Sulphur and Argent vive to be that, which being most pure must
                        <lb/>be extracted out of two mountains
