                        <lb/>Philosophers seeds are to be cast into their earth. These same things
                        <lb/>are ascribed to Osiris, who to tha end tooke a view of the whole world,
                        <lb/>as wee have elswhere demonstrated, and to Dionysius, who travelled<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>throughout the world teaching men the use of wine: Now these three
                        <lb/>Triptolemus, Osiris, and Dionysius are of one intention and office,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>yea one thing; as allso Achilles, who being most valiant was to be<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>sent to the Trojane warre; his father was Peleus, that is, earth, or the
                        <lb/>mountaine Peleus, his mother Thetis goddesse of the Sea or waters; from
                        <lb/>these Achilles descended: But at their nuptialls the golden apple of Eris
                        <lb/>was produced, the first cause of the Trojane warre, wherefore pro
                        <lb break="no"/>ceding from those nuptialls reason there was that hee should determine
                        <lb/>it: Achilles is sayd to be hardened by his mother after the same manner<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>as the aforesayd Triptolemus by Ceres, concerning whome wee have
                        <lb/>sayd enough in the 6th booke of Hieroglyphicks, which here to repeat<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>wee thinke superfluous. The nutriment therefore of the Stone is fire,
                        <lb/>but it is not thereby (as some may falsely imagine) extended into lon
                        <lb break="no"/>gitude, latitude, and profundity, nor doth it receive increment in<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>weight; because it acquires onely virtue, maturation, and colour from
                        <lb/>fire, carrying all the rest with it as viaticke provisions: For when its<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>parts are from severall places congested, purged, and conjoyned, it hath in
                        <lb/>it all things requisite for it: Whereupon sayth a Philosopher in the Ro

                        <lb/>Nor indeed is any strange thing added to it from the beginning to the

                        <lb/>But every man ought to consider, before hee begin any thing, how hee
                        <lb/>may come to the knowledge of those Dragons that are to be joyned to
                        <lb/>the chariot of Triptolemus, which are winged and volatile, which

                        <lb/>for they are dung, and are generated from dung, and are that vessell,
                        <lb/>which Mary sayth, is not negromanticall, but the regiment of your
                        <lb/>fire, without which you will effect nothing: I have revealed to you<pc>-</pc>
