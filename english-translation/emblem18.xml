                        <lb/>Anatomy of mans body, in which one muscle serves onely for one motion,
                        <lb/>that is, the attractive, but for the expansive another opposite to the first, soe
                        <lb/>that if any part or member be to be brought into a circular forme, it must
                        <lb/>be effected by various muscles placed circle=wise: soe the operation of fire
                        <lb/>is one and single, that is to say, to heat and fire, yea assimilate to itselfe, and
                        <lb/>burne all things, to which it is applyed, if they be combustible: Hereupon
                        <lb/>Sayth Avicenne in his booke of the congelation of stones: That which falls into Salt
                        <lb break="no"/>pitts, becomes Salt, and that which into fire, becomes fire, but somethings sooner,
                        <lb/>some Slower, according to the power of atives <!-- should be actives? -->, and the resisteme of passives: And
                        <lb/>there is a place in Arabia, which coloureth all bodyes in it of its owne colour: Soe
                        <lb/>every naturall thing possesseth the virtue infusd into it by nature, by which
                        <lb/>it acts upon things mixd or applyed to it, assimilating and altering their nature
                        <lb/>and forme: That which is generation in vegetables and animalls by the pro
                        <lb break="no"/>pagation of seeds, is the infusion of virtue and assimilation in single bodyes
                        <lb/>or singly mixd: the Sunne, the light of heaven, projects its rayes upon the
                        <lb/>earth, which, being gathered together in concavous or burning glasses, doe demon
                        <lb break="no"/>strate themselves to be produced from such a cause, as to appear to be the
                        <lb/>projectible formes of the Sunne: Whereby it is manifest that the rayes of the
                        <lb/>Sunne are nothing els, but a fiery flame extended and dispersed into an ample
                        <lb/>latitude, which being dilated and againe contracted by concavous, diaphanous
                        <lb/>and circular or repercussive instruments, doth in concavous and steele mirrors
                        <lb/>Shine as a flame, and burne things obvious to it: after the same manner, a
                        <lb/>certaine virtue is as a vapour dispersed in a certaine elemented body, which,
                        <lb/>if it be gathered together, and attracted into one, turnes into water, and that
                        <lb/>water into earth: For this reason sayth Avicenne in the booke before alleadged,
                        <lb/>Earth is made of water, when the qualityes of earth overcome it, and soe on
                        <lb/>the contrary: But there is a certaine thing, which some ingenious men doe
                        <lb/>use when they have a mind to coagulate a dry substance, which is com
                        <lb break="no"/>pounded of two waters, and is called Lac virginis, which is the most certaine
                        <lb/>effect of it: this Sayth hee: Some <del><unclear reason="illegible">are</unclear></del>there are that assure themselves
                        <lb/>able to increase or multiply virtues in the Load=stone, as the like wee have
                        <lb/>seen sett in Silver, which being scarce one pound weight attracted and held up an
                        <lb/>iron anchor of 28 pounds, which would have been impossible, if the virtue
                        <lb/>had not been increasd and made stronger in it, which without doubt was
                        <lb/>done by revocation of the dispersed virtues as it were into one point or pole,
                        <lb/>or by the attraction of the same out of a great body into a lesse: Others are
                        <lb/>found, who say that a plumbifying Stone may be made by the Sulphurous
                        <lb/>breath of Saturne, infused and retained, till it be thereby converted into
                        <lb/>comon Mercury, which continually converts comon Mercury into lead.
                        <lb/>Some boast that they can by Antimony, or the stellated Regulus there
                        <lb break="no"/>of make Copper from the fume of Copper, in that time wherein a
                        <lb/>man may eat an egge, yea that they have made all metalls: but
                        <lb/>I will not detract from their reputation, though to mee it seems not

                        <lb/>likely to be true: I know not whether they are more confident or
                        <lb/>successefull, who endeavour to deduce gold from gold, according to the
                        <lb/>saying of the golden poett: Hee that desires barley sowes onely barley,
                        <lb/>in gold is the seed of gold: Every naturall thing hath indeed a certaine
                        <lb/>virtue of multiplying itselfe, but these things are brought into action
                        <lb/>in Vegetables and animalls onely, not at all in Metalls, Mineralls, things
                        <lb/>dugge out of the earth, or Meteor: Some plants sprung from a small
                        <lb/>graine of seed doe oftentimes yeild a thousand or more grains of seed,
                        <lb/>and soe multiply and propagate themselves, and that yearly; Ani
                        <lb break="no"/>malls allso have their products of greater or lesse number, according
                        <lb/>to the nature of every one: But gold, Silver, lead, tinne, iron, copper, or
                        <lb/>Argent vive are never found to have multiplyd themselves or their species
                        <lb/>after that manner, though one may be very often found commuted and
                        <lb/>nobilitated into another: Neverthelesse the Philosophers affirme that the
                        <lb/>principle of ignifying is in fire, soe of aurifying in gold: but where is
                        <lb/>the tincture, by which gold must be made? This must be sought in
                        <lb/>its owne principles and generations, not in things of another nature: For
                        <lb/>if fire produceth fire, a Pear, a horse a horse, then lead must
                        <lb/>generate lead and not Silver, gold gold and not the tincture: Moreover
                        <lb/>the Philosophers have a peculiar gold, which they doe not onely not
                        <lb/>deny that it ought (but allso affirme it necessarily requisite) to be
                        <lb/>added to the aurificke Stone as a ferment as the end of the worke. The
                        <lb/>ferment, converting the thing fermented into its owne nature, without
                        <lb/>which the whole composition would never come to perfection
