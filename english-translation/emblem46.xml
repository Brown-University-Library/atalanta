                        <lb/>The miserable woman after tedious wandrings was at length brought
                        <lb/>by a Shipp to the Island Ortygia, to her sister Asteries, who therein
                        <lb/>reigned: And that Island, being allmost all overflowed with the Sea,
                        <lb/>gave place to Latona being in travell, whereupon it was called Delos,<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>Diana, and shee did the office of a midwife to her mother labouring<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>to bring forth her brother Apollo; From whence it came to passe<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>that women going with Child did in the time of their labour
                        <lb/>invoke her deity, and calld her either Lucina or Ilithya, be

                        <lb/>they made lightening for Jupiter to destroy his Sonne Æsculapius,

                        <lb/>hee had restord Hippolytus to life being torne in peices by horses.
                        <lb/>Wee have in many places demonstrated these things to be merely
                        <lb/>Chymicall: For Latona, Cynthia, Apollo, and Python are requisites of
                        <lb/>the art, which have such a relation one to the other, as hath been
                        <lb/>declared; but these things being divulged in the writings of the most
                        <lb/>ancient Poetts, as Orphens, Linus, Musæus, Homer, Ct. have given the
                        <lb/>ignorant occasion to ascribe religion and veneration to Apollo: Here
                        <lb break="no"/>upon Apollo is in many places of Europe and Asia worshipped,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>and innumerable temples erected to him; And especially at Delphos
                        <lb/>hee had a temple to be worshipped by ancient religion, wherein a great
                        <lb/>number of statues made of solid gold and silver or great weight<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>and artifice was reposited by Kings and Princes, with other most
                        <lb/>pretious gifts, which were hidden in sacred places for religion sake
                        <lb/>by men of all degrees. Pausanias reports that a brazen Skeleton of
                        <lb/>admirable artifice was hung at the top of the temple by Hippocrates.
                        <lb/>That famous Tripos was allso consecrated to Apollo by Pelops, at the
                        <lb/>time when hee marryed Hippodamia the daughter Œnomaus King
                        <lb/>of Elis, which Tripos Mulciber made, and gave to Pelops: It was
                        <lb/>erected in the midle of the temple, in which Pythia sitting

                        <lb/>prophesyd, and gave responses to those that desird to know the events of things
                        <lb/>to come: Delphos was indeed in Bœotica seated about the foot of Parnassus.<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Near to the temple was the divining fountaine, named Cassiotis, which, if bur
                        <lb break="no"/>ning torches was brought to it did extinguish them: if they were removed
                        <lb/>farre of, they were suddenly kindled, and tooke fire; and the water of<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>that fountaine being dranke yeilded the virtue of divining, but not
                        <lb break="no"/>withstanding the drinkers of that water were made of shorter life. Con

                        <lb/>Delphicke Oracle, the Poets feigne that place, namely Parnassus to be<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>in the midle of the earth, and that they proed by an example of Jupi
                        <lb break="no"/>ter, who had experimented it by sending forth two Eagles: But this thing
                        <lb/>not being supported by the reputation of history, it is not derogatory from the
                        <lb/>truth, to ascribe it to Chymicall matters, especially Apollo being, as hath been<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>declared, alltogether Chymicall by originall, though the Devill afterwards<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>confirmed the superstition of men, and gave prophesyes under that name.
                        <lb/>The two Eagles are two stones, whereof one comes from the East, the<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>other from the West, which the Philosophers have many wayes demonstra
                        <lb break="no"/>ted. Jupiter sends them forth, as his Ensigne=bearers. The Eagle seems in
                        <lb break="no"/>deed a freind to Apollo or the Sunne, in proving her chickens at the Sunne,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>which if they cannot endure, Shee disownes them as illegitimate. Its feathers
                        <lb/>being joyned with other things are sayd not to putrefy, and to devoure
                        <lb/>the feathers of other birds, easily admitting gilding allso: By old age, or
                        <lb/>sicknesse it dyes not, but by famine; For the upper beake growes soe
                        <lb/>crooked that it cannot receive food: Which having cast off it plungeth it
                        <lb break="no"/>selfe three times in a fountaine, and soe is sayd to returne to youth.<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Hereupon sayth the Psalmist: Your youth shall be renewed as the<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>youth of an Eagle: This of all birds is never affected with Lightening:
                        <lb/>It warrs with the dragon, which hunts after its eggs for the sake of<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb break="no"/>sophers reason to prædicate the Eagle in their art, and assimilate the
