                        <lb/>necessary to the naturall worke, namely Lully, the Author of Scala, Ripley,
                        <lb/>and many others: and to this end Raymund speakingof fires (sayth Scala).
                        <lb/>You must note, that here are contrary operations: because as the fire
                        <lb/>against nature dissolves the Spirit of a fixed body into the water of a
                        <lb/>cloud, and binds the body of a volatile spirit into a congealed earth, soe
                        <lb/>contrarywise the fire of nature congeales the dissolved spirit of a fixed
                        <lb/>body into a globous earth, and resolves the fixed body of a volatile
                        <lb/>Spirit by fire against nature, not into the water of a cloud, but into Phi
                        <lb break="no"/>losophicall water. Ripley speaks more clearly of these fires in gate 3. thus:
                        <lb/>There are four sorts of fires, which you ought to know, the naturall, unna
                        <lb break="no"/>turall, fire against nature, and elementall, which kindleth wood: These
                        <lb/>fires wee use, and noe more. Fire against nature ought to excruciate
                        <lb/>bodyes, that is the dragon, as I tell you, violently burning, as the fire of hell.
                        <lb/>The fire of nature is the third menstruum, that fire is naturally in every
                        <lb/>thing: Occasioned fire wee call unnaturall, as the heat of ashes and baths
                        <lb/>to putrefy: Without these fires you can bring nothing to putrefaction, where
                        <lb break="no"/>by your matter may be separated, that it may at once be proportioned
                        <lb/>for a new conjunction: Make therefore a fire within in your glasse, which
                        <lb/>can burne bodyes more effectually, than elementall fire: these are their
                        <lb/>sayings. They are indeed called fires, because they have a fiery virtue,
                        <lb/>the naturall in coagulating, the unnaturall in dissolving, the fire against
                        <lb/>nature in corrupting, the elementall in administring the first heat and
                        <lb/>motion: And there is a concatenated order observed in them, that the Se
                        <lb break="no"/>cond may be incited by the first, the third by the second, the fourth by
                        <lb/>the third and first together to action, soe as that one is the agent, and
                        <lb/>the other the patient, and the same both agent and patient in different
                        <lb/>respect: That which is observed in iron rings or pillars held together by a
                        <lb/>Magnet, and joyned by mutuall contact, the same in these fires: for the
                        <lb/>elementall doth like the Magnet immit its virtue though the second
                        <lb/>and third even to the fourth, and joynes one to another by mutuall
                        <lb/>operations, and causeth them to sticke together, till internall action be
                        <lb/>effected amongst the uppermost: The first is elementall fire indeed
                        <lb/>and name, the second is aire or airy, the third watry or of a Lunar na
                        <lb break="no"/>ture, the fourth earthy: It is needlesse to say any thing of the first,
                        <lb/>because it is knowne to every mans eye and touch: The three other are
                        <lb/>dragons, menstrua's <!-- apostrophe? -->, waters, Sulphurs, and Mercuryes: Dragons, because
                        <lb/>being participants of venenosity, they devoure serpents of their owne
                        <lb/>kind, frett and alter, that is, dissolve and coagulate bodyes incorporated
                        <lb/>and mixed with them: They are called Menstrua's, because the Philoso
                        <lb break="no"/>phicall infant is produced from them, and nourished therewith even to
                        <lb/>its nativity: Lully in his booke of the Quintessence, dist. 3. hath two

                        <lb/>menstruums, the vegetable, and minerall, Ripley in his praeface of the gates hath
                        <lb/>three, which are really one and doe agree: for the generation of the infant
                        <lb/>is made of them alltogether, and a while water praeceeds the birth of it, which
                        <lb/>is not of the substance but superfluity of the infant, and therefore to be
                        <lb/>separated: They are waters, because in fire they Shew a watry nature, that
                        <lb/>is, flowing and liquidity, which agrees with water: Manifest it is that the
                        <lb/>propertyes of waters are different and wonderfull, whereof some doe petrefy, be
                        <lb break="no"/>ing coagulated into very hard stones fitt for building: Very like these are the
                        <lb/>Philosophers minerall waters, which doe condense, and turne into a stony con
                        <lb break="no"/>sistence: They are allso called Sulphurs because of the virtue of Sulphur,
                        <lb/>which they comprehend in them, for the Sulphur of nature is mixed and
                        <lb/>made one with the other Sulphur, and the two Sulphurs are dissolved by one,
                        <lb/>and one is separated from two, and the Sulphurs are praeserved and contained
                        <lb/>by Sulphur, as Yximidius in Turba sayth: Now what Sulphurs are Dardaris
                        <lb/>there declares in these words: Sulphurs are Souls hidden in the fower elements,
                        <lb/>which being extracted by art doe naturally containe one another and are
                        <lb/>joyned together: if you can by water governe and purify well that which
                        <lb/>is hidden in the belly of Sulphur, that hidden thing meeting with its owne
                        <lb/>nature rejoyceth, even as water with its like. I will now tell you (sayth Mosius
                        <lb break="no"/>allso) what it is: the first indeed, which is fiery Argent vive, the second, the
                        <lb/>body compounded in it, and the third is the water of Sulphur, by which the
                        <lb/>first is washd, and dilacerated, and governed, till the worke be accomplished:
                        <lb/>That which is sayd of Sulphurs, the same may be understood of soe
                        <lb/>many Mercuryes: For this sayth the same Mosius afterwards: Argent vive
                        <lb/>Cambar is the Magnesia, but Argent vive or Auripigment is that Sulphur
                        <lb/>which ascends from a mixd compound: But I will omitt the inference of
                        <lb/>more testimonyes, they being infinite and obvious to every man: These foure
                        <lb/>fires are included as it were in Spheres and orbes, that is, every one hath a
                        <lb/>particular center, from which or to which their motion tends, but neverthelesse
                        <lb/>they are kept soe bound together partly by nature, partly by art, that one
                        <lb/>can operate little or nothing without another, yea the action of one is the
                        <lb/>passion of another, and on the contrary
