                        <lb/>necessary to the <orig>naturall</orig> <orig>worke</orig>, namely Lully, the Author of Scala, Ripley,
                        <lb/>and many others: and to this end Raymund speaking of fires (<orig>Sayth</orig> Scala).
                        <lb/>You must note, that here are contrary operations: because as the fire<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>against nature dissolves the Spirit of a fixed body into the water of a<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>cloud, and binds the body of a volatile spirit into a congealed earth, <choice><orig>soe</orig><reg>so></reg></choice

                        <lb/>body into a globous earth, and resolves the fixed body of a volatile<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Spirit by fire against nature, not into the water of a cloud, but into <orig>Phi
                        <lb break="no"/>losophicall</orig> water. Ripley speaks more clearly of these fires in gate 3. thus:
                        <lb/>There are four sorts of fires, which you ought to know, the <orig>naturall</orig>, u<orig>nna
                        <lb break="no"/>turall</orig>, fire against nature, and <orig>elementall</orig>, which <choice><orig>kindleth</orig><reg>kindles</reg></choice> wood: These
                        <lb/>fires <orig>wee</orig> use, and <orig>noe</orig> more. Fire against nature ought to excruciate<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/><orig>bodyes</orig>, that is the dragon, as I tell you, violently burning, as the fire of hell.
                        <lb/>The fire of nature is the third menstruum, that fire is naturally in every
                        <lb/>thing: Occasioned fire <orig>wee</orig> call <orig>unnaturall</orig>, as the heat of ashes and baths
                        <lb/>to putrefy: Without these fires you can bring nothing to putrefaction, where
                        <lb break="no"/>by your matter may be separated, that it may at once be proportioned<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>for a new conjunction: Make therefore a fire within in your <orig>glasse</orig>, which
                        <lb/>can <orig>burne</orig> <orig>bodyes</orig> more effectually, than <orig>elementall</orig> fire: these are their
                        <lb/>sayings. They are indeed called fires, because they have a fiery virtue,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>the <orig>naturall</orig> in coagulating, the <orig>unnaturall</orig> in dissolving, the fire against
                        <lb/>nature in corrupting, the <orig>elementall</orig> in <choice><orig>administring</orig><reg>administering</reg></choice> the first heat and
                        <lb/>motion: And there is a concatenated order observed in them, that the Se
                        <lb break="no"/>cond may be incited by the first, the third by the second, the fourth by
                        <lb/>the third and first together to action, <choice><orig>soe</orig><reg>so></reg></choice as that one is the agent, and
                        <lb/>the other the patient, and the same both agent and patient in different
                        <lb/>respect: That which is observed in iron rings or pillars held together by a
                        <lb/>Magnet, and <orig>joyned</orig> by <orig>mutuall</orig> contact, the same in these fires: for the

                        <lb/>and third even to the fourth, and <orig>joynes</orig> one to another by <orig>mutuall</orig><pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>because it is <orig>knowne</orig> to every mans eye and touch: The three other are

                        <lb/>separated: They are waters, because in fire they <choice><orig>Shew</orig><reg>Show</reg></choice> a <orig>watry</orig> nature, that
                        <lb/>is, flowing and liquidity, which agrees with water: Manifest it is that the<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>which they comprehend in them, for the Sulphur of nature is mixed and<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>made one with the other Sulphur, and the two Sulphurs are dissolved by one,
                        <lb/>and one is separated from two, and the Sulphurs are <orig>præserved</orig> and contained
                        <lb/>by Sulphur, as Yximidius in Turba <orig>sayth</orig>: Now what Sulphurs are Dardaris
                        <lb/>there declares in these words: Sulphurs are Souls hidden in the fower elements,

                        <lb/>That which is <orig>sayd</orig> of Sulphurs, the same may be understood of <choice><orig>soe</orig><reg>so></reg></choice<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>many <orig>Mercuryes</orig>: For this <orig>sayth</orig> the same Mosius afterwards: Argent vive
                        <lb/>Cambar is the Magnesia, but Argent vive or Auripigment is that Sulphur
