                        <lb/>and many others: and to this end Raymund speaking of fires (<orig>Sayth</orig> Scala).
                        <lb/>You must note, that here are contrary operations: because as the fire<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>against nature dissolves the Spirit of a fixed body into the water of a<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb break="no"/>losophicall</orig> water. Ripley speaks more clearly of these fires in gate 3. thus:
                        <lb/>There are four sorts of fires, which you ought to know, the <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice>naturall</orig>, u<orig>nna
                        <lb break="no"/>turall</orig>, fire against nature, and <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice>elementall</orig>, which <choice><orig>kindleth</orig><reg>kindles</reg></choice> wood: These
                        <lb/>fires <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice>wee</orig> use, and <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice>noe</orig> more. Fire against nature ought to excruciate<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/><orig>bodyes</orig>, that is the dragon, as I tell you, violently burning, as the fire of hell.
                        <lb/>The fire of nature is the third menstruum, that fire is naturally in every
                        <lb/>thing: Occasioned fire <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice>wee</orig> call <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice>unnaturall</orig>, as the heat of ashes and baths
                        <lb/>to putrefy: Without these fires you can bring nothing to putrefaction, where
                        <lb break="no"/>by your matter may be separated, that it may at once be proportioned<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>for a new conjunction: Make therefore a fire within in your <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice>glasse</orig>, which
                        <lb/>can <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice>burne</orig> <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice>bodyes</orig> more effectually, than <choice><orig>wee</orig><reg>we</reg></choice>elementall</orig> fire: these are their
                        <lb/>sayings. They are indeed called fires, because they have a fiery virtue,<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>motion: And there is a concatenated order observed in them, that the Se

                        <lb/>the third and first together to action, <choice><orig>soe</orig><reg>so</reg></choice> as that one is the agent, and
                        <lb/>the other the patient, and the same both agent and patient in different
                        <lb/>respect: That which is observed in iron rings or pillars held together by a
