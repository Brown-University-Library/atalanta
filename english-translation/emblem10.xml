                        <lb/>to its like makes a similar augmentation: and therefore physicians affirme
                        <lb/>that contrary diseases are cured and taken away by contrary medicines,
                        <lb/>soe wee see that fire is extinguished by water, but sustained by adding
                        <lb/>fire: The poet is of the same opinion saying: Venus rageth in wine, fire in
                        <lb/>fire: but it may be answered, that fire and fire, Mercury and Mercury are
                        <lb/>very different one from another: for there are many kinds of fires with the
                        <lb/>philosophers, many allso of Mercury: Moreover the same heat and cold
                        <lb/>being distant onely in place or situation, differs from another of its owne
                        <lb/>kind, soe as to attract to it that which is like to itselfe, that heat fixed in
                        <lb/>any part is attracted and drawne forth by the same heat, and that the
                        <lb/>joynts being stupefyd with the cold of winter, and allmost dead with cold
                        <lb/>water, are restored if they be put into it, not by externall heat imediately
                        <lb/>administred: as indeed a greater light obscures the lesse, soe allso greater heat the
                        <lb/>lesse, and greater cold the lesse: neverthelesse it is requisite for the externall
                        <lb/>heat and cold to be lesse, than that which was before fixed or imprinted on the
                        <lb/>parts or joynts, otherwise the same impression would be made, as before, and
                        <lb/>the like would be much more increased, than drawne out, by the like: for
                        <lb/>the drawing out of cold by cold water, and of fiery heat by heat is agreable to
                        <lb/>nature, because every sudden mutation into a contrary is dangerous to it, and
                        <lb/>lesse acceptable, but that which is by little and little, and as it were by degrees
                        <lb/>is tolerable: soe wee say, there is one internall fire, and is allready infixed
                        <lb/>and essentiall in the philosophicall subject, and another externall, which may
                        <lb/>allso be understood of Mercury: that is an internall fire aequivocally because
                        <lb/>of its fiery qualities, virtues, and operations, externall univocally: Externall fire
                        <lb/>therfore must be given to the internall, and the like Mercury to Mercury,
                        <lb/>that the intention of the art may be completed: To mollify or mature any
                        <lb/>hard or crude thing by coction, wee use fire and water: for water dissolves
                        <lb/>hardnesse, and penetrates into the compact parts, heat adding strength and
                        <lb/>motion to it; as appears by example in the coction of peas, which are of
                        <lb/>themselves sound and hard, but doe swell, are broken, and reduced to a
                        <lb/>pulpe by water, the heat of fire rarefying the water by ebullition, and
                        <lb/>making it of a more thinne or allmost airy substance: soe the heat of
                        <lb/>fire resolves the crude parts of fruit or flesh into water, and causeth them
                        <lb/>to evaporate with it into aire: after the same manner fire and Mercury
                        <lb/>here are fire and water, and the same, fire and Mercury are the mature
                        <lb/>and crude parts, of which the crude are to be matured by coction, or the
                        <lb/>mature purged from superfluityes by the ministery of fire and water:
                        <lb/>Now that these are two fires, and two Mercuryes principally and solely ne
                        <lb break="no"/>cessary to the art, wee will here breifely demonstrate: Empedocles deter
                        <lb break="no"/>mined two principles of all things, love, and variance, or freindship and dis

                        <lb break="no"/>cord: that by variance corruptions were made, generations by love: such vari
                        <lb break="no"/>ance is manifestly beheld between fire and water, fire causing water to eva
                        <lb break="no"/>porate, if it can, water on the contrary extinguishing fire, if admitted to it:
                        <lb/>but for all that it is conspicuous that generations may be made of the same
                        <lb/>with some certaine freindship; for by heat a new generation of aire is made
                        <lb/>of water, and by the same the induration of water into a stone, and soe
                        <lb/>out of these two Elements as it were the first are made allso the other two,
                        <lb/>and by consequence the production of all things: Water was the matter
                        <lb/>of heaven, and of all corporall things: Fire, as the forme, movs and in
                        <lb break="no"/>forms this matter; soe this water or Mercury yeilds the matter, and fire
                        <lb/>Sulphur, the forme: which two, that they may come to operation, and
                        <lb/>move themselves mutually by solution, coagulation, alteration, tinction,
                        <lb/>and perfection, have need of externall helps, as instruments, without
                        <lb/>which noe effect could follow: For as a smith effects nothing without
                        <lb/>hammer and fire, soe neither the philosopher without his instruments,
                        <lb/>which are water and fire: And this water is called by some the water of
                        <lb/>clouds, as this fire occasioned fire: It is without doubt calld the water of
                        <lb/>clouds, because it is distilld, as the dew of May, of most thinne parts: for
                        <lb/>as the dew of the sayd moneth being included in an eggshell is affirmed to
                        <lb/>rayse the egge, or its continent, high by the heat of the sunne, soe allso
                        <lb/>this water of the clouds, or dew makes the philosophes egge ascend, that
                        <lb/>is, sublimes, exalts, and perfects it: The same water is allso most sharp
                        <lb/>vinegar, which hath made a body a mere Spirit: for as vinegar is of dif
                        <lb break="no"/>ferent qualityes, namely to penetrate to the bottome, and astringe, soe
                        <lb/>this water dissolves and coagulates, but is not coagulated, because it is
                        <lb/>not of a proper subject: Now this water is had from the fountaine of
                        <lb/>Parnassus, which contrary to the nature of other fountains is at the top
                        <lb/>of a mountaine, made by the hoofe of the flying horse Pegasus.
                        <lb/>There must allso be actuall fire, which notwithstanding must be go
                        <lb break="no"/>verned and qualifyed by its degrees, as by bridles. For as the sunne
                        <lb/>proceding from Aries into Leo gradually increaseth heat to things
                        <lb/>growing, by approaching allwayes nearer, soe is it here necessary to be
                        <lb/>done: for the philosophers infant must be nourished by fire, as milke,
                        <lb/>the more hee growes, the more fruitfull
