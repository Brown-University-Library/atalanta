                        <lb/>are they unknowne to us by names: Story tells us of a very great bird appearing at a

                        <lb break="no"/>quire after the eggs of these birds: The Aegyptians doe yearly infest, and as it
                        <lb/>were with a publicke warre denounced prosecute the Eggs of Crocodiles with
                        <lb/>weapons of iron; the philosophers doe burne their egge with fire, not to mortify
                        <lb/>and destroy it, but that it may receive life and growth; for when a chicken is
                        <lb/>from theme produced animated and living, it cannot be sayd to be the corruption
                        <lb/>but generation of it: it ceaseth indeed to be an egge by the privation of the ovall
                        <lb/>forme, and begins to be an animall with two feet and volatile by the introduction
                        <lb/>of a more noble forme: In an egge are the seeds of both male and female
                        <lb/>joyned together under one cover or shell: The yolke constitutes the chicken,
                        <lb/>and the radicall parts and bowells thereof, the seed of the male being the
                        <lb/>former, and internall efficient: The white yeilds matter, or thread and incre

                        <lb break="no"/>ther with instinct and guidance of nature introduce a new forme by
                        <lb/>changing one thing into another: for water turnes into aire, aire into fire, and
                        <lb/>fire into earth, upon the conjunction of which, a specificke forme being trans
                        <lb break="no"/>mitted by the starrs, an individuall is made of a certaine kind of bird, namely
                        <lb/>of that, whose egge it was, and seed infused in it. Is it indeed sayd to be smitten
                        <lb/>with a fiery sword, whilst Vulcan officiating the duty of a midwife gives pas
                        <lb break="no"/>sage or egresse to the chicken by his axe, as to pallas outout of the braine of Ju
                        <lb break="no"/>piter: This is that which Basill Valentine affirms, that Mercury was impri
                        <lb break="no"/>soned by Vulcan at the comand of Mars, and not released, before hee was
                        <lb/>wholy putrefyd and dead: but this death is to him the begining of a new life,
                        <lb/>as the corruption or death of an egge brings new generation and life to the
                        <lb/>chicken, soe an Embryo being freed from that humane vegetable life (which
                        <lb/>alone hee enjoyed in his mothers wombe, another more perfect is obtained by
                        <lb/>coming into the light of this world, as by nativity: yea allso wee being de
                        <lb break="no"/>prived of this present life, which wee lead, another most perfect and aeter
                        <lb break="no"/>nall is at hand: Thus Lully doth in many places call this fiery sword a
                        <lb/>sharp spear; because fire doth as a sharp spear or sword perforate bodyes,
                        <lb/>and make them porous and pervious, that water can penetrate to dissolve
                        <lb/>and reduce them from hardnesse to softnesse and tractability. In the
                        <lb/>stomacke of a Cormorant, which is of all birds most voracious, are found
                        <lb/>long and round wormes alive, which are to it as the instrument of heat,
                        <lb/>they forthwith invading, and as most sharp noodles perforating, (as wee
                        <lb/>have sometimes observed) and soe in a very short time consuming
                        <lb/>the Eeles and other fish taken by it, with a wonderfull operation of na
                        <lb break="no"/>ture: as therefore heat pricketh, soe a thing pricking sometimes supplys the

                        <lb/>place of heat: upon which consideration that, wherewith the philosophers egge
                        <lb/>ought to be pieced and smitten, may not undeservedly be called a fiery sword:
                        <lb/>but the philosophers had rather have it understood of a temperate heat, where
                        <lb break="no"/>by the egge is kept warme, as Morfolens in Turba declares, saying, wise men
                        <lb/>ought to burne away moisture first with a slow fire, as is shewed to us by an
                        <lb/>example in the generation of a chicken, and where the fire is augmented,
                        <lb/>the vessell must be stopd on all sides, that the body of the brasse, and the
                        <lb/>fugitive spirit thereof may not exhale. But what birds was the egge? Mos

                        <lb/>stone, of which powder are made fitt instruments for the egge; yet they
