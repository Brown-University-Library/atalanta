                        <lb/>Persia, it is sayd that fountains of sweet water are very rarely found,
                        <lb/>standing waters being brackish, and the Soyle itselfe in the surface<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>yeilding much saltnesse: After the same manner the King, which the
                        <lb/>Philosophers have made mention of being perplexed with thirst, com
                        <lb break="no"/>manded plenty of sweet water to be brought him, of which hee dranke
                        <lb/>his fill; as if manifest to any man by the Allegory of Merlinus. The

                        <lb/>being yet crude, which Hippocrates affirms ought to be purged being<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>first concocted, unlesse they be fluxible and uncertaine: For then they

                        <lb/>in a chronicke disease, restored the King to his former health. It is well<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>worth while to cure soe great a King, who being made sound extends a
                        <lb/>liberall hand and a serene aspect to his Physician. Wee have read that<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>many mens cures have been very nobly rewarded by severall Kings, as<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>that of Domocides by Polycrates a tyrant of Samos with two talents, of
                        <lb/>Erasiscratus (who, as Pliny writes, was Schollar of Chrysippus, begotten<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>upon the daughter of Aristotle) for curing King Antiochus being sicke
                        <lb/>for the love of his Stepmother Stratonice, with a hundred talents by his
                        <lb/>Sonne Ptolemy, of Jacob Cocterius, Physician of Lewis the 2d <!-- unsure if this is right --> King of<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>France, from whome hee receivd four thousand Crowns every moneth as
                        <lb/>a stipend, and other later wee make noe mention of; but the cure of
                        <lb/>this King is recompensed with yet a farre greater gratuity or reward. For
                        <lb/>thus say Hermes and Geber in the Rosary: Hee that hath once com

                        <lb/>every day feed four thousand men, would not want. This Senior con

                        <lb/>is soe rich, as hee that hath fire, can give fire, to whome hee will, and<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>when hee will, and as much as hee will without his owne detriment or want.
                        <lb/>The father of Democritus was soe rich, that hee gave a feast to the<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>army of Xerxes, and Pythius a man exceding wealthy offered to the<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>into the Kings army, but the barbarous King taking the petition of Pythius
                        <lb/>most unworthily, comanded his younger sonne to be cutt in two peices,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>and fastened to stakes on both sides the high way, by which his whole ar
                        <lb break="no"/>my was to passe, as Sabellicus observes in booke 2. Ennead 3. but the riches
                        <lb/>of these men are nothing to the riches of our King, which are without<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>dimension and number. Being cured and freed from the waters all the
                        <lb/>Kings, and Potentates of other regions did honour and fear him: And when
                        <lb/>they were willing to see any of his wonderfull works, they putt one<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>ounce of Mercury well washd in a crucible, and cast thereupon (as it were
                        <lb/>one graine of Millet seed) of his nayls, or of his harre or blood, and<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>blowd gently with coales, they let it coole with them, and found such a
                        <lb/>stone as I know. This is hee, whome Count Bernhard mentioneth, that<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>gives to his six courtiers soe much of his kingdome, as hee himselfe possesseth,
                        <lb/>provided they waite, till hee recover youth in the bath, and be adorned<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>with various garments, namely, a blacke breast=plate, a white shirt, and
                        <lb/>purple blood; for then hee promiseth to give some of his blood to every
                        <lb/>one, and make them partakers of his riches<pc>. . . . . . . .</pc>
