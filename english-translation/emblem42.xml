                        <lb/>guide another, the same thing happens to them as to blind men, if

                        <lb/>little or noe good at all: For by these, as by four wheeles, the Philo

                        <lb/>wanting, if it be left, it avayls nothing. Nature præsupposeth natu

                        <lb/>which art must afterwards act, præparing, purifying, and fitting it,
                        <lb/>that thereof may be made that, which art promiseth for the end:
                        <lb/>Soe a Potter takes water and earth, a Glasse=maker ashes and<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Sand, a Smith iron, copper, tinne, lead, Silver or gold, a Tanner
                        <lb/>raw hides, and soe other men other things: Such respect allso<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>hath the operator of Chymistry to his materialls: Their materi
                        <lb break="no"/>alls are to them very well knowne even the first day, hee, when
                        <lb/>hee begins, continues for the most part ignorant of his for many
                        <lb/>years, I will not say, during his whole life. Nature doth indeed<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>impression of nature, that it cannot be knowne. The first intention<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>therefore is, seriously to contemplate how nature proceeds in her ope
                        <lb break="no"/>rations to the end that the naturall subjects of Chymistry may<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>without defect or superfluity be had: Wherefore Nature must be<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>the guide and companion of soe great a journey, whose footsteps<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>must be traced. Secondly, reason must be as a staffe to keep the<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>steps and feet steady and firme, that they may not slip or waver,
                        <lb/>For without the exercise of reason a man will be apt to fall<pc>-</pc>

                        <lb/>into errours, and therefore say the Philosophers; Whatsoever you hear,
                        <lb/>consult with reason, whether it can be soe, or noe: For noe man is
                        <lb/>forced to beleive or performe things impossible, except hee be of<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>weake memory, dull genius, and foolish imagination to impose upon
                        <lb/>himselfe accepting things false for true, and rejecting true for false:
                        <lb/>They say allso that they care not for words, whatsoever may be<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>spoken, but onely for things, what may be understood; And that
                        <lb/>words are for things, and not things for words: As for example, Suppose
                        <lb/>a man say that glasse is made malleable by the Philosophicall<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>tincture; Why Shall not I beleive it, if provided reason dictates it?<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Thirdly, Experience will be as Spectacles, by which things may be<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>seen at a distance; These are opticke instruments, invented and made
                        <lb/>by art, to helpe and amend the weaknesse of mens eyes. Much like to
                        <lb/>these are experiments about the minerall matter of every kind tryed,
                        <lb/>seen or truely heard, which the more they are in memory, the more
                        <lb/>will a man of reason draw from thence, and compare them among<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>and with other things, that hee may perceive, what is true, what not<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>Fourthly, Reading dos as it were kindle a clear lamp in the understan

                        <lb/>clouds. But the reading of good authors ought to be often repeated,<pc>-</pc>
                        <lb/>otherwise it will not be at all effectuall. Hereupon Bacasser in Turba
                        <lb/>sayth: Hee therefore, that is of an even temper, and exerciseth pati
                        <lb break="no"/>ence without regrett, will attaine to this art as by a direct line, but

                        <lb/>is deceived, and it had been better not to have lookd therein, than<pc>-</pc>
