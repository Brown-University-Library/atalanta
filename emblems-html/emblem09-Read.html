         <span class="milestone">e09-01</span>All things whatsoever <span class="reg">do</span> grow in length, breadth, and depth, that is, are  propagated, nourished, and augmented to maturity, the same things <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> decrease, that is, are diminished in <span class="reg">faculties</span>, <span class="reg">die</span>, and are wholly demolished, as is manifestly evident in all vegetables and <span class="reg">animals</span>: <span class="milestone">e09-02</span>wherefore man
                         <span class="reg">also</span> having arrived at full growth <span class="reg">admits</span> of decrement, that is, old age, whereby
                         his strength is gradually diminished even till the approach of death: now the
                         cause of old age is the same as is of a <span class="reg">lamp</span> decaying, and shining obscurely
                         the <span class="reg">oil</span> being <span class="reg">almost</span> consumed: <span class="milestone">e09-03</span>For as there are three things in a <span class="reg">lamp</span>, the  match, <span class="reg">fatness</span>, and flame, <span class="reg">so</span> in man the <span class="reg">vital</span> parts, <span class="reg">bowels</span>, and ligaments
                         are the match, <span class="reg">fatness</span> the <span class="reg">radical</span> moisture, flame the <span class="reg">natural</span> heat; <span class="milestone">e09-04</span>all
                         the difference is that the flame of a <span class="reg">lamp</span> shines, the <span class="reg">natural</span> heat not at all,
                         it not being fire, but <span class="reg">only</span> heat, and that <span class="reg">fatness</span> is <span class="reg">oily</span>, the <span class="reg">radical</span> moisture viscous, as being of a <span class="reg">seminal</span> principle: <span class="milestone">e09-05</span>As <span class="reg">also</span> a <span class="reg">lamp</span> is extinguished
                         through want of <span class="reg">oil</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> man by old age, without any other disease, falls
                         into a marasme, and aged consumption, and lastly death: <span class="milestone">e09-06</span>They relate  of the Eagle, that in old age being <span class="reg">hindered</span> by a crooked <span class="reg">beak</span> it would
                         be famished to death, if it were not restord by nature as it were to  youth by casting the <span class="reg">beak</span>: <span class="milestone">e09-07</span>
         <span class="reg">So</span> Harts seem to grow young <span class="reg">again</span> by
                         throwing of their <span class="reg">horns</span>, serpents their <span class="reg">skins</span>, and crabs their shells;  not indeed really, because the consumed <span class="reg">radical</span> moisture is not restored
                         to them, but as to appearance: <span class="milestone">e09-08</span>that which can make a man grow young
                         <span class="reg">again</span> is nothing, but death <span class="reg">itself</span>, and the <span class="reg">beginning</span> of <span class="reg">eternal</span> life
                         ensuing: as to <span class="reg">external</span>
         <span class="reg">form</span>, and the <span class="reg">restoration</span> of strength in  some measure, together with the taking away of wrinkles and gray  <span class="reg">hairs</span>, some there are that say a remedy may be found, which Lully
                         affirms of the Quintessence, Arnold of <span class="reg">prepared</span> gold: <span class="milestone">e09-09</span>But here  the Philosophers say, that an old man, to become young, must be  <span class="reg">shut</span> up with a <span class="reg">certain</span> tree in a house of dew, and then <span class="reg">he</span> will
                         eat of the fruit of the tree, and <span class="reg">so</span> recover youth: It is scarce <span class="reg">believed</span> by the vulgar that such trees are now in the nature of things:
                         <span class="milestone">e09-10</span>Of Myrobalans, the fruit of a tree, <span class="reg">Physicians</span> write wonders, as if  they could <span class="reg">perform</span> such a thing, take away gray <span class="reg">hairs</span>, purify the
                         blood, and prolong life: <span class="milestone">e09-11</span>but these things are doubted by many men,
                         <span class="reg">unless</span> they are <span class="reg">said</span> to effect it by accident, as <span class="reg">also</span> other things, which
                         purge the <span class="reg">mass</span> of blood from <span class="reg">feces</span>
         <span class="reg">mixed</span> with it, and dye gray <span class="reg">hair</span> with <span class="reg">blackness</span>, with which Myrobalans are reported to <span class="reg">color</span> the
                         <span class="reg">hair</span> a<span class="underline">nd ball of</span> the eyes. <span class="milestone">e09-12</span>Marsilius Ficinus in his booke of <span class="reg">preserving</span> the life of students, writes, that in order to <span class="reg">attain</span> to long life
                         it is <span class="reg">commodious</span> for a man <span class="reg">daily</span> to <span class="reg">suck</span> the <span class="reg">milk</span> of some <span class="reg">certain</span> 
         <span class="reg">beautiful</span> and young woman, instead of which others <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">commend</span> the eating of vipers flesh: <span class="milestone">e09-13</span>but indeed these means are themselves

         <span class="fw">Discourse 9.</span> more rigid than old age, and scarce to be used by one of a thousand,  though they Should not be without <span class="reg">certain</span> effect: It is written by Paracelsus in his <span class="reg">book</span> of long life, that a <span class="reg">sick</span> man may attract to <span class="reg">himself</span> the health of another by imagination alone, as <span class="reg">also</span> an old man
                         youth, but<span class="underline"> this Author seems in this</span> to <span class="underline">use his imagination <span class="reg">only</span>, not
                         experience:</span>
         <span class="milestone">e09-14</span>It is thing <span class="reg">certain</span> of the Psylli who have two balls of the
                         eye, and of witches, that they bewitch children and cattle by aspect alone,
                         from whence that of <span class="reg">Virgil</span>: Nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinet agnos:
                         <span class="milestone">e09-15</span>but these things are done without contact, whereby the tree restores the  old man to youth: for this tree <span class="reg">has</span> sweet fruit, ripe and red, which <span class="reg">do</span> easily <span class="reg">turn</span> into pure blood, being of easy digestion and excellent nutriment, <span class="reg">so</span> as to leave nothing superfluous or <span class="reg">feculent</span> in the body: <span class="milestone">e09-16</span>but  the old man abounds with white <span class="reg">phlegm</span>, and is of a white <span class="reg">color</span> and  hairy, which humor, <span class="reg">color</span>, and <span class="reg">hair</span> are changed by eating these  fruits, and become red, as those are of young men. <span class="milestone">e09-17</span>For this reason say the
                         Philosophers, the Stone is first old, that is white, then young, that is, red, because
                         this is the <span class="reg">color</span> of youth, as that of old age: <span class="milestone">e09-18</span>It is added, that the old man  ought to be <span class="reg">Shut</span> up with the tree, not in the open <span class="reg">air</span>, but in a house, not
                         dry, but moist with dew. <span class="milestone">e09-19</span>It is accounted a miracle for trees to Spring or vegetate
                         in a close place, but if it be moist, there is <span class="reg">no</span> doubt of their long duration:
                         for the nutriment of a tree is moisture, and airy earth, that is, <span class="reg">fat</span>, which
                         can ascend into the <span class="reg">trunk</span> and <span class="reg">boughs</span>, and there produce leaves, flowers,
                         and fruit, <span class="milestone">e09-20</span>in which <span class="reg">natural</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span> all the Elements <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">concur</span>, fire  giving the first motion, as the efficient, <span class="reg">air</span> tenuity and penetrability, water
                         lubricity, earth coagulation: for <span class="reg">air</span> returns into water, and water into  earth, if any of their superfluity ascend: <span class="milestone">e09-21</span>By fire I <span class="reg">mean</span> the <span class="reg">natural</span> heat, which being propagated with the seed <span class="reg">does</span> by the power of the <span class="reg">Stars</span> as it were a Smith fabricate and <span class="reg">form</span> fruit like to those things from whence
                         the seed <span class="reg">arises</span>: <span class="milestone">e09-22</span>But a dewy evaporation is not <span class="add">
            <span class="reg">only</span>
         </span> good and expedient to moisten
                         the tree, that it may more easily <span class="reg">yield</span> fruit, but <span class="reg">also</span> the old man, that by
                         those fruits <span class="reg">he</span> may become young <span class="reg">again</span>, that is to say, the dewy evaporation mollifying, filling up, and restoring his wrinkled and dry <span class="reg">Skin</span> with temperate heat and moisture: <span class="milestone">e09-23</span>for <span class="reg">Physicians</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> advisedly and with
                         great utility <span class="reg">enjoin</span> and <span class="reg">prescribe</span>
         <span class="reg">warm</span> baths in the marasme and  aged consumption: <span class="milestone">e09-24</span>
         <span class="underline">but if</span> the thing be well considered that tree is the  daughter of the old man, which as Daphne is transmuted into a vegetable
                         of the like sort, and therefore the old man <span class="reg">does</span> not without reason expect
                         youth from it, which caused it to be effected . . . . . . .</div>
