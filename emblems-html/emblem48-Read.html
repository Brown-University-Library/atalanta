      <div class="ab"> Xerxes that most potent King of Persia leading his army through dry <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> and rugged places in <span class="reg">hot</span> weather, being thirsty, refused not a draught  of muddy water offered by a <span class="reg">soldier</span>, but <span class="reg">drank</span> most freely, and rewarded
                         him that brought it very amply. And indeed if a man at this very time
                         (as some of the latest historians <span class="reg">affirm</span>) <span class="reg">travel</span> through the borders of
                         Persia, it is <span class="reg">said</span> that fountains of sweet water are very rarely found,
                         standing waters being brackish, and the <span class="reg">Soil</span>
         <span class="reg">itself</span> in the surface  <span class="reg">yielding</span> much <span class="reg">saltness</span>: After the same manner the King, which the
                         Philosophers have made mention of being perplexed with thirst, commanded plenty of sweet water to be brought him, of which <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">drank</span> his fill; as if manifest to any man by the Allegory of Merlinus. The
                         cure of the <span class="reg">sick</span> and <span class="reg">discolored</span> King is undertaken by <span class="reg">several</span>
         <span class="reg">Physicians</span>: The <span class="reg">Egyptians</span>
         <span class="reg">administering</span> their medicines stirred the humors
                         being yet crude, which Hippocrates affirms ought to be purged being  first concocted, <span class="reg">unless</span> they be fluxible and <span class="reg">uncertain</span>: For then they
                         must be forthwith expelled, that they may not peradventure make an
                         assault upon the more noble parts or <span class="reg">bowels</span>. Hereupon dangerous Symptoms, such as Hipothymy and Syncope happened to the King, but the <span class="reg">Physicians</span> of Alexandria coming last of all, and esteemed more <span class="reg">successful</span> in a <span class="reg">chronic</span> disease, restored the King to his former health. It is well  worth while to cure <span class="reg">so</span> great a King, who being made sound extends a
                         <span class="reg">liberal</span> hand and a serene aspect to his <span class="reg">Physician</span>. <span class="reg">We</span> have read that  many mens cures have been very nobly rewarded by <span class="reg">several</span> Kings, as  that of Democides by Polycrates a tyrant of Samos with two talents, of
                         Erasistratus (who, as Pliny writes, was <span class="reg">Scholar</span> of Chrysippus, begotten  upon the daughter of Aristotle) for curing King Antiochus being <span class="reg">sick</span> for the love of his Stepmother Stratonice, with a hundred talents by his
                         <span class="reg">Son</span> Ptolemy, of Jacob Cocterius, <span class="reg">Physician</span> of <span class="reg">Louis II</span> King of  France, from <span class="reg">whom</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">received</span> four thousand Crowns every <span class="reg">month</span> as
                         a stipend, and other later <span class="reg">we</span> make <span class="reg">no</span> mention of; but the cure of
                         this King is recompensed with yet a <span class="reg">far</span> greater gratuity or reward. For
                         thus say Hermes and Geber in the Rosary: <span class="reg">He</span> that <span class="reg">has</span> once completed this art, if <span class="reg">he</span> should live ten hundred thousand years, and  every day feed four thousand men, would not want. This Senior confirms, saying: <span class="reg">He</span> that <span class="reg">has</span> that stone, whereof the Elixir is made
                         is <span class="reg">so</span> rich, as <span class="reg">he</span> that <span class="reg">has</span> fire, can give fire, to <span class="reg">whom</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> will, and  when <span class="reg">he</span> will, and as much as <span class="reg">he</span> will without his <span class="reg">own</span> detriment or want.
                         The father of Democritus was <span class="reg">so</span> rich, that <span class="reg">he</span> gave a feast to the  army of Xerxes, and Pythius a man <span class="reg">exceeding</span> wealthy offered to the  same pay for his whole army, and <span class="reg">victual</span> for five <span class="reg">months</span>, provided  that the youngest of his five <span class="reg">sons</span>, which was the comfort of his old  age, might be permitted to stay at home, and not be <span class="reg">constrained</span> to <span class="reg">go</span>
         <span class="pb">151</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 48.</span> into the Kings army, but the barbarous King taking the petition of Pythius
                         most unworthily, <span class="reg">commanded</span> his younger <span class="reg">son</span> to be <span class="reg">cut</span> in two <span class="reg">pieces</span>,  and fastened to stakes on both sides the high way, by which his whole army was to <span class="reg">pass</span>, as Sabellicus observes in <span class="reg">book</span> 2. Ennead 3. but the riches
                         of these men are nothing to the riches of our King, which are without  dimension and number. Being cured and freed from the waters all the
                         Kings, and potentates of other regions did <span class="reg">honor</span> and fear him: And when
                         they were willing to see any of his <span class="reg">wonderful</span> works, they <span class="reg">put</span> one  ounce of Mercury well <span class="reg">washed</span> in a crucible, and cast thereupon (as it were
                         one <span class="reg">grain</span> of Millet seed) of his <span class="reg">nails</span>, or of his <span class="reg">hair</span> or blood, and  <span class="reg">blowed</span> gently with <span class="reg">coals</span>, they let it <span class="reg">cool</span> with them, and found such a
                         stone as I know. This is <span class="reg">he</span>, <span class="reg">whom</span> Count Bernhard <span class="reg">mentions</span>, that  gives to his six courtiers <span class="reg">so</span> much of his <span class="reg">kingdom</span>, as <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">himself</span>
         <span class="reg">possesses</span>,
                         provided they <span class="reg">wait</span>, till <span class="reg">he</span> recover youth in the bath, and be adorned  with various garments, namely, a <span class="reg">black</span> breastplate, a white shirt, and
                         purple blood; for then <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">promises</span> to give some of his blood to every
                         one, and make them partakers of his riches . . . . . . . .</div>
