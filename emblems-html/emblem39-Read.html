      <div class="ab"> Bacasser a Philosopher in Turba <span class="reg">says</span>, that which you <span class="reg">seek</span> for is of <span class="reg">no</span> small<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> value, for you <span class="reg">seek</span> the greatest treasure, and most excellent gift of God.  And <span class="reg">learn</span>, O yee students, that which the Philosophers have long since intimated, saying, The truth is not discerned but by <span class="reg">error</span>, and nothing begets  more <span class="reg">grief</span> to the heart, than <span class="reg">error</span> in this art and <span class="reg">work</span>: For when a man
                         thinks <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span> done, <span class="reg">has</span> a world, <span class="reg">he</span> will find nothing in his  hands. These same things the ancient Philosophers were <span class="reg">pleased</span> to signify, propounding a <span class="reg">Sphinx</span> as if <span class="reg">she</span> denoted the obscurity and meanders of art. For this reason the <span class="reg">Egyptians</span>, in their
                         sacred Isiaci, which were celebrated in <span class="reg">honor</span> of Osiris, by mitred
                         <span class="reg">Priests</span>, with heads shaven, and all parts of the body <span class="reg">clothed</span> with
                         a white <span class="reg">linen</span> garment <span class="reg">down</span> to the ankles, that they might not
                         be <span class="reg">known</span> or discovered to the <span class="reg">common</span> people, erected a Statue of
                         Silence, which was called Sigalion, in the entrance of the altar,  the assistants being <span class="reg">enjoined</span> to keep silence, and <span class="reg">turn</span> their  eyes to that image, and for the same cause they added the effigies of <span class="reg">Sphinxes</span> at the corners of the altar, which did represent
                         the <span class="reg">mystical</span> knowledge of sacred things; as <span class="underline">Boissardus</span>
         <span class="reg">does</span> from<span class="note-mark">*</span>
         <div class="margin-note">
            <span class="note-mark">*</span>Boissardus?</div> ancient Authors demonstrate: For <span class="reg">Sphinx</span> is a <span class="reg">certain</span> kind of monster most obscure to the Thebans, propounding riddles, nor <span class="reg">only</span> to  them, but as before to the <span class="reg">Egyptians</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> after all others to those that  aspire to art, and <span class="reg">watches</span> in the Philosophers books as before the gates of
                         Thebes; if any man can <span class="reg">pass</span> by the monster, <span class="reg">he</span> suffers <span class="reg">no</span>
         <span class="reg">evil</span> by
                         him, but <span class="reg">he</span> that through <span class="reg">presumption</span> of mind or <span class="reg">wit</span>
         <span class="reg">endeavors</span> to  resolve his riddles, and cannot <span class="reg">perform</span>, acquires his <span class="reg">own</span> destruction,  that is, <span class="reg">grief</span> to the heart, and damage to his <span class="reg">affairs</span> by <span class="reg">error</span> in this  <span class="reg">work</span>. <span class="reg">He</span> that <span class="reg">refers</span> such <span class="reg">allegories</span> to history, <span class="reg">has</span> a <span class="reg">mushroom</span> for  a head, and a <span class="reg">Melon</span> for a heart, as the <span class="reg">Comedian</span>
         <span class="reg">says</span>, and <span class="reg">knows</span>
         <span class="reg">no</span> more than that <span class="reg">he</span> deviates from the right way. Those things are too
                         childish, and <span class="reg">fit</span> for old wives, if they be taken literally, otherwise the
                         signs and tokens of profound learning. Monstrous wild beasts are indeed
                         <span class="reg">said</span> to be in Africa by the name of <span class="reg">Sphinxes</span>, but here <span class="reg">we</span> discourse not
                         of them, though the <span class="reg">original</span> and denomination of this fiction seems to  be derived from them. The Philosophers <span class="reg">Sphinx</span> understands and  <span class="reg">uses</span>
         <span class="reg">human</span> speech, namely <span class="reg">Greek</span>, as <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">propounds</span>
         <span class="reg">Subtle</span> sentences and <span class="reg">enigmatical</span>
         <span class="reg">questions</span>, in which appears a singular <span class="reg">Sharpness</span> of understanding and learning, not <span class="reg">so</span> obvious to all other men,
                         from which brutes are <span class="reg">exceeding</span> distant. <span class="reg">He</span> that is conversant in  the Philosophers assertions will easily know them to be such: For  where one thing is <span class="reg">said</span>, and another thing <span class="reg">signified</span>, there <span class="reg">equivocation</span>
         <span class="reg">begets</span>
         <span class="reg">error</span>, which is not <span class="reg">only</span> permitted, but <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">enjoined</span>
         <span class="pb">124</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 39.</span> to the Philosophers alone: The City of Thebes therefore being long  perplexed with the riddles of <span class="reg">Sphinx</span> at length came one <span class="reg">Oedipus</span>,  who gave such responses to the <span class="reg">questions</span> offered, that <span class="reg">Sphinx</span> could
                         not forbear throwing <span class="reg">herself</span> downe from a <span class="reg">rock</span>. But who is this  <span class="reg">Oedipus</span>? The <span class="reg">Son</span> of the King of Thebes, who being <span class="reg">born</span>, it being <span class="reg">predicted</span> to his father by an oracle, that <span class="reg">he</span> should be <span class="reg">Slain</span> by his <span class="reg">Son</span>, <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">commanded</span>
         <span class="reg">Oedipus</span> to be <span class="reg">killed</span>, who being <span class="reg">hanged</span> upon a tree and left with a rope fastened <span class="reg">cross</span> his feet, was released by another countryman, and brought up; <span class="reg">He</span> coming to mans
                         estate had indeed <span class="reg">swelled</span> feet, but sufficiently declared a <span class="reg">quick</span> 
         <span class="reg">wit</span> above all men in unriddling this <span class="reg">enigma</span> propounded by <span class="reg">Sphinx</span>.
                         But Sphinx is reported to have had many riddles, though this the <span class="reg">chief</span>,
                         offered to <span class="reg">Oedipus</span>. What is that which in the morning <span class="reg">goes</span> upon <span class="reg">four</span> feet, at <span class="reg">noon</span> upon two, in the evening upon three? what was <span class="reg">answered</span> by <span class="reg">Oedipus</span> is not <span class="reg">known</span>; but some interpret it to the age of man, who
                         are deceived: For a Quadrangle or the four Elements of all things are
                         first to be considered, from hence <span class="reg">we</span> come to the hemisphere having
                         two lines one <span class="reg">straight</span> the other crooked, that is, white Luna, from hence
                         to a Triangle, which consists of body, Spirit, and <span class="reg">Soul</span>, or Sol, Luna,
                         and Mercury: Hereupon <span class="reg">says</span> Rhasis in his Epistle. The Stone is a Triangle in being, a Quadrangle in quality. Hereto <span class="reg">also</span> relates the one
                         and <span class="reg">twentieth</span>
         <span class="reg">emblem</span>, and the exposition thereof. <span class="reg">Oedipus</span> moreover
                         is notorious for parricide and incest, which are two the most detestable  vices, as can ever be thought of, but <span class="reg">nevertheless</span> they promoted him to a
                         <span class="reg">kingdom</span>, otherwise due to him, <span class="reg">he</span> having unawares killed his father  refusing to give way to him, and <span class="reg">married</span> the Queen, the wife of Laius,
                         his <span class="reg">own</span> mother. But this written not to be imitated by any man as
                         history, or example, it being <span class="reg">only</span> feigned and allegorically introduced by the Philosophers to discover the secrets of their doctrine. For
                         in this <span class="reg">work</span> both happen; the first efficient, that is, the father, being
                         <span class="reg">killed</span> and destroyed by his effect, that is, the <span class="reg">Son</span>, and afterwards  the same effect <span class="reg">joined</span> the second efficient to <span class="reg">himself</span>, till <span class="reg">she</span> become one with him, and <span class="reg">so</span> the <span class="reg">Son</span> is coupled to his mother by  matrimony, and <span class="reg">enjoins</span> his fathers <span class="reg">kingdom</span>, as it were by a triple  right, of <span class="reg">arms</span>, <span class="reg">wedlock</span>, and succession. <span class="reg">He</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">swelled</span> feet, because
                         <span class="reg">he</span> cannot <span class="reg">run</span>, and is as a bear, as <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">contains</span> the greatest secret, or a toad, going with a slow pace; because it is fixed fixing  another, and not <span class="reg">avoiding</span> or fearing fire, which though a medium
                         of mean repute the Philosophers can by <span class="reg">no</span> means be without . .</div>
