         <span class="reg">we</span> find to be taken <span class="reg">diverse</span>
         <span class="reg">ways</span>: for the Astro<span class="milestone">e03-01</span>nomers repute him the highest of the <span class="reg">Planets</span> in order; the young students
                         of Chymistry the meanest of <span class="reg">metals</span>, namely lead: The heathen Poets: <span class="reg">conceived</span> him to be the father of Jupiter, <span class="reg">Son</span> of CÃ¦lum; the Mythologists time.
                         But though all these may seem to have thought aright in their sense, yet  they will not declare those things which are <span class="reg">elsewhere</span> spoken of <span class="reg">Saturn</span>,  why <span class="reg">he</span> devoured and vomited up his <span class="reg">sons</span>, and a stone instead of Jupiter,
                         why <span class="reg">he</span> is the discoverer of truth, why appearing with a <span class="reg">scythe</span>, a serpent,  <span class="reg">blackness</span>, morosity, and distorted feet? Herein the last <span class="reg">think</span> themselves to
                         interpret best, saying, that time <span class="reg">reveals</span> and manifests truth, slides away as a Serpent, cuts all things <span class="reg">down</span> with death as by a <span class="reg">scythe</span>, <span class="reg">devours</span> its children, that is,
                         all those things which it <span class="reg">has</span> generated, digests hard stones, or cannot consume
                         them, and therefore <span class="reg">does</span> as it were vomit them up <span class="reg">again</span>: These things <span class="reg">do</span> indeed
                         agree in part, but are not consonant to the truth of the thing, and all circumstances. But the exercises Philosophers <span class="reg">do</span> say, that <span class="reg">Saturn</span> is first in their
                         <span class="reg">work</span>, which if <span class="reg">he</span> be really <span class="reg">present</span>, they cannot <span class="reg">err</span>, truth is discovered in
                         <span class="reg">darkness</span>; but there is nothing besides <span class="reg">blackness</span>: wherefore they say in  Turba Philosophorum, whatsoever <span class="reg">color</span> comes after <span class="reg">blackness</span> is laudable:
                         and when you see your matter <span class="reg">black</span>, <span class="reg">rejoice</span>, because it is the <span class="reg">beginning</span> of  the <span class="reg">work</span>: And, when it is first <span class="reg">black</span>, <span class="reg">we</span> say it is the key of the <span class="reg">work</span>,  because it is not effected without <span class="reg">blackness</span>, as the Rosary <span class="reg">has</span> it, with Arnold,
                         and the Speculum: when you are operating, <span class="reg">endeavor</span> to <span class="reg">obtain</span> first a  <span class="reg">black</span>
         <span class="reg">color</span>, and then will you be <span class="reg">certain</span> that you putrefy, and proceed
                         the right way. And a little after: that <span class="reg">blackness</span> is called earth, which is made
                         by light decoction <span class="reg">so</span> often repeated, till <span class="reg">blackness</span> be most eminent: For  this reason say the same, that <span class="reg">Saturn</span>
         <span class="reg">possesses</span> the earth, Mercury water,  Jupiter <span class="reg">air</span>, Sol fire. <span class="reg">Saturn</span> therefore is <span class="reg">blackness</span>, the discoverer of truth,
                         who <span class="reg">follows</span> a stone instead of Jupiter. For <span class="reg">blackness</span>, that is, a <span class="reg">dark</span> cloud
                         covers the stone as first, that it cannot be seen: Therefore <span class="reg">says</span> Morienes  every body without a <span class="reg">soul</span> is <span class="reg">dark</span> and obscure: And Hermes: Take his head  dissolve it with the Sharpest vinegar, or the urine of children, till it be made  <span class="reg">dark</span>: This being performed <span class="reg">he</span> lives in putrefaction, and the <span class="reg">dark</span> clouds which
                         were upon him, and in his body, before <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">died</span>, are returned. This stone is  <span class="reg">again</span> disgorged by <span class="reg">Saturn</span>, when it becomes white, and then is it <span class="reg">set</span> upon  the top of Helicon for a monument to men, as Hesiod writes: for <span class="reg">whiteness</span> is
                         really comprehended under <span class="reg">blackness</span>, which is <span class="reg">drawn</span> out of its <span class="reg">bowels</span>, that
                         is, out of the <span class="reg">stomach</span> of <span class="reg">Saturn</span>. therefore <span class="reg">says</span> Democritus; putrify <span class="reg">Tin</span> with a peculiar ablution, draw its <span class="reg">blackness</span> and obscurity from it, and the
                         <span class="reg">whiteness</span> of it will appear. And in Turba it is <span class="reg">said</span>: <span class="reg">Join</span> the dry with
                         the moist, that is, the <span class="reg">black</span> earth with its water, and coct, till it be whitened.
                         This Arnold in Novum lumen chapt. 4. excellently declares, saying; That  moisture therefore which caused <span class="reg">blackness</span> in decoction, <span class="reg">Shows</span>
         <span class="reg">itself</span> to be  <span class="reg">dried</span>, when the white <span class="reg">color</span> begins to appear. And a little after: And  my Master <span class="reg">said</span> to <span class="reg">me</span>, that that brunity ascended, because the <span class="reg">whiteness</span>
         <span class="pb">43</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 12.</span> was <span class="reg">drawn</span> out of the belly of its <span class="reg">blackness</span>, as is <span class="reg">said</span> in Turba: For when  you see it <span class="reg">black</span> know that the <span class="reg">whiteness</span> of it is hidden in the <span class="reg">bowels</span> of the
                         <span class="reg">blackness</span> first appearing. As the Same <span class="reg">blackness</span> is called <span class="reg">Saturn</span>, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> Lead: Thereupon <span class="reg">says</span> Agadimon in Turba: Coct your <span class="reg">brass</span>, till the <span class="reg">blackness</span> come forth,
                         which they call money, and mix the matters of your art, and you will find <span class="reg">blackness</span> presently, which is the Philosophers lead, of which they have treated much in their  books: Hitherto relates the saying of Emiganus, that the Splendor of <span class="reg">Saturn</span> ascending
                         into the <span class="reg">air</span> appears <span class="reg">no</span> otherwise than darkened. And of Plato in the Rosary; The
                         first way of governing <span class="reg">Saturn</span> is to putrefy and put it upon Sol: by which it is evident  that the sense of the Philosophers, speaking of <span class="reg">Saturn</span>, is <span class="reg">far</span> different from the
                         <span class="reg">common</span> acceptation. This <span class="reg">Saturn</span> generates Jupiter, that is, an obscure <span class="reg">whiteness</span>, Jupiter
                         of Latona Diana, that is perfect <span class="reg">whiteness</span>, and Apollo, that is, <span class="reg">redness</span>; and this is
                         the successive mutation of all perfect <span class="reg">colors</span>: This Stone cast out by <span class="reg">Saturn</span> is
                         reported to be placed at the top of the <span class="reg">mountain</span> as a monument to men, which
                         is a thing most true . . . . . . . . . . . .</div>
