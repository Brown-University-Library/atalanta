         <span class="milestone">e10-01</span>If this saying be taken literally, it <span class="reg">only</span>
         <span class="reg">increases</span> the quality of fire and Mercury, and <span class="reg">introduces</span>
         <span class="reg">no</span> new quality in the subject: for every like being added
                         to its like makes a similar augmentation: <span class="milestone">e10-02</span>and therefore <span class="reg">Physicians</span>
         <span class="reg">affirm</span> that contrary diseases are cured and taken away by contrary medicines,  <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">we</span> see that fire is extinguished by water, but sustained by adding
                         fire: <span class="milestone">e10-03</span>The Poet is of the same opinion saying: Venus <span class="reg">rages</span> in wine, fire in
                         fire: <span class="milestone">e10-04</span>but it may be answered, that fire and fire, Mercury and Mercury are
                         very different one from another: for there are many kinds of fires with the
                         Philosophers, many <span class="reg">also</span> of Mercury: <span class="milestone">e10-05</span>Moreover the same heat and cold  being distant <span class="reg">only</span> in place or situation, differs from another of its <span class="reg">own</span> kind, <span class="reg">so</span> as to attract to it that which is like to <span class="reg">itself</span>, that heat fixed in  any part is attracted and <span class="reg">drawn</span> forth by the same heat, and that the  <span class="underline">
            <span class="reg">joints</span> being <span class="reg">stupefied</span> with the cold of winter, and</span>
         <span class="underline">
            <span class="reg">almost</span>
         </span> dead with cold
                         water, are restored if they be put <span class="underline">into it, not by <span class="reg">external</span> heat <span class="reg">immediately</span>
         </span> 
         <span class="reg">administered</span>: <span class="milestone">e10-06</span>as indeed a greater light obscures the <span class="reg">less</span>, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> greater heat the
                         <span class="reg">less</span>, and greater cold the <span class="reg">less</span>: <span class="reg">nevertheless</span> it is requisite for the <span class="reg">external</span> heat and cold to be <span class="reg">less</span>, than that which was before fixed or imprinted on the
                         parts or <span class="reg">joints</span>, otherwise the same impression would be made, as before, and  the like would be much more increased, than <span class="reg">drawn</span> out, by the like: <span class="milestone">e10-07</span>for  the drawing out of cold by cold water, and of fiery heat by heat is <span class="reg">agreeable</span> to
                         nature, because every sudden mutation into a contrary is dangerous to it, and  <span class="reg">less</span> acceptable, but that which is by little and little, and as it were by degrees
                         is tolerable: <span class="milestone">e10-08</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">we</span> say, there is one <span class="reg">internal</span> fire, and is <span class="reg">already</span> infixed  and <span class="reg">essential</span> in the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> subject, another <span class="reg">external</span>, which may
                         <span class="reg">also</span> be understood of Mercury: <span class="milestone">e10-09</span>that is an <span class="reg">internal</span> fire <span class="reg">equivocally</span> because
                         of its fiery qualities, virtues, and operations, <span class="reg">external</span> univocally: <span class="reg">External</span> fire
                         therefore must be given to the <span class="reg">internal</span>, and the like Mercury to Mercury,  that the intention of the art may be completed: To mollify or mature any  hard or crude thing by coction, <span class="reg">we</span> use fire and water: <span class="milestone">e10-10</span>for water dissolves  <span class="reg">hardness</span>, and penetrates into the compact parts, heat adding strength and  motion to it; as appears by example in the coction of Peas, which are of
                         themselves sound and hard, but <span class="reg">do</span> swell, are broken, and reduced to a  <span class="reg">pulp</span> by water, the heat of fire rarefying the water by ebullition, and
                         making it of a more <span class="reg">thin</span> or <span class="reg">almost</span> airy substance: <span class="reg">So</span> the heat of
                         fire resolves the crude parts of fruit or flesh into water, and <span class="reg">causes</span> them
                         to evaporate with it into <span class="reg">air</span>: <span class="milestone">e10-11</span>after the same manner fire and Mercury
                         here are fire and water, and the same, fire and Mercury are the mature
                         and crude parts, of which the crude are to be matured by coction, or the
                         mature purged from <span class="reg">superfluities</span> by the ministery of fire and water:  <span class="milestone">e10-12</span>Now that these are two fires, and two <span class="reg">Mercuries</span> principally and solely necessary to the art, <span class="reg">we</span> will here <span class="reg">briefly</span> demonstrate: <span class="milestone">e10-13</span>Empedocles determined two principles of all things, love, and variance, or <span class="reg">friendship</span> and dis
                        
                        
                        <span class="pb">37</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 10.</span>cord: that by variance corruptions were made, generations by love: such variance is manifestly beheld between fire and water, fire causing water to evaporate, if it can, water on the contrary extinguishing fire, if admitted to it:  <span class="milestone">e10-14</span>but for all that it is conspicuous that generations may be made of the same  with some <span class="reg">certain</span>
         <span class="reg">friendship</span>; for by heat a new generation of <span class="reg">air</span> is made
                         of water, and by the same the induration of water into a stone, and <span class="reg">so</span> out of these two Elements as it were the first are made <span class="reg">also</span> the other two,  and by consequence the production of all things: <span class="milestone">e10-15</span>Water was the matter  of heaven, and of all <span class="reg">corporal</span> things: Fire, as the <span class="reg">form</span>, moves and informs this matter; <span class="reg">so</span> this water or Mercury <span class="reg">yields</span> the matter, and fire  or Sulphur, the <span class="reg">form</span>: <span class="milestone">e10-16</span>which two, that they may come to operation, and
                         move themselves mutually by solution, coagulation, alteration, tinction,
                         and perfection, <span class="underline">have n</span>ee<span class="underline">d of <span class="reg">external</span> helps, as instruments, without</span>

                         clouds, because it is <span class="reg">distilled</span>, as the dew of May, of most <span class="reg">thin</span> parts: for  as the dew of the <span class="reg">said</span>
         <span class="reg">month</span> being included in an eggshell is affirmed to
                         <span class="reg">raise</span> the <span class="reg">egg</span>, or its continent, high by the heat of the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> this water of the clouds, or dew makes the Philosophers <span class="reg">egg</span> ascend, that
                         is, sublimes, exalts, and perfects it: <span class="milestone">e10-18</span>The same water is <span class="reg">also</span> most Sharp  vinegar, which <span class="reg">has</span> made a body a mere Spirit: for as vinegar is of different <span class="reg">qualities</span>, namely to penetrate to the <span class="reg">bottom</span>, and astringe, <span class="reg">so</span> this water dissolves and coagulates, but is not coagulated, because it is  not of a proper subject: <span class="milestone">e10-19</span>Now this water is had from the <span class="reg">fountain</span> of  Parnassus, which contrary to the nature of other fountains is at the top <span class="note-mark">*</span>
