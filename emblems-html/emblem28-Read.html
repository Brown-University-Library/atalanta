      <div class="ab"> As there are three concoctions in man, the first in the <span class="reg">Stomach</span>, the second<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> in the Liver, the third in the veins, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> many are the <span class="reg">universal</span> evacuations of the excrements, which are correspondent to them, and daily
                         carry <span class="reg">off</span> their <span class="reg">superfluities</span>, namely the first by <span class="reg">Stool</span>, which is proper to
                         the first concoction, the second by urine, which <span class="reg">appertains</span> to the second,
                         the third by expiration through the pores of the whole body, or by  sweat, which is peculiar to the third: In the first the Chyle, in the next the  Chyme, in the last a dew or dewy substance is elaborated, and <span class="reg">applied</span> to  every part of the body: The recrements or <span class="reg">feces</span> of the first are <span class="reg">thick</span>,
                         bilious, and <span class="reg">fat</span>, which are <span class="reg">carried</span> through the <span class="reg">bowels</span> to the <span class="reg">back</span>
         <span class="reg">door</span>,
                         and if they be at any time obstructed, they are moderately or strongly
                         expelled by gentle purgatives; the excrements of the second are liquid,  more <span class="reg">thin</span>, bilious and saltish, which are brought out of the veins by
                         the <span class="reg">kidneys</span> and bladder, as conduits, and the sediment of these is the <span class="reg">sign</span> or touchstone of urine: The <span class="reg">superfluities</span> of the third are yet more  <span class="reg">thin</span>, and therefore <span class="reg">do</span> for the most part expire of themselves  through the smallest pores, or are <span class="reg">carried</span> out together with the serum of
                         the humors, as sweat: These are <span class="reg">helped</span> by <span class="reg">sudorifics</span>, as <span class="add">the</span> antecedent by  <span class="reg">diuretics</span>: To evacuate these last <span class="reg">feces</span> the ancient Greeks and Romans  were very solicitous: For to this end were <span class="reg">so</span> many sports and exercises used
                         by them, as chafing of all the parts in the morning, <span class="reg">anointing</span> with <span class="reg">oil</span>,  and <span class="reg">wrestling</span>, fencing, the exercise of running, of handball, <span class="reg">tennis</span>, daily washing and bathing in rivers or <span class="reg">artificial</span> baths, for the conveniency
                         of which were <span class="reg">so</span> many magnificent structures built at Rome, that <span class="reg">we</span> can rather admire than imitate them: As for example the baths of Dioclesian, which for the most part are yet remaining, and (if I be not  mistaken) <span class="reg">portrayed</span> with <span class="reg">Archangels</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> high, sumptuous, and splendid
                         were the <span class="reg">works</span>: The sorts of concoctions in the elaboration of <span class="reg">metals</span> are  <span class="reg">almost</span> the saine, as those <span class="reg">aforesaid</span>: for the first is in its way effected  in annus magnus, that is, the revolution of the highest Sphere, the second in the revolution of the lowest, the third in the revolution of the<span class="reg">middle</span> Sphere: But the Philosophers to draw forth this <span class="reg">mass</span> of excrementitious
                         <span class="reg">superfluities</span> more <span class="reg">commodiously</span> by the ministery of art, <span class="reg">do</span> invent <span class="reg">also</span> 
         <span class="reg">several</span>
         <span class="reg">ways</span>, as ablutions, purgations, balneations and <span class="reg">laconica</span>, by which
                         they have <span class="reg">performed</span> that in the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span>, which <span class="reg">Physicians</span> have in mans body: Duenech therefore is introduced into the bath by  Pharut, there to sweat, and evacuate the <span class="reg">feces</span> of the third concoction  through the pores: Now this Kings distemper is <span class="reg">melancholic</span> or atrabilary,  whereby <span class="reg">he</span> is of <span class="reg">less</span> authority and <span class="reg">esteem</span> than all other princes, being
                         taxed with the morosity of <span class="reg">Saturn</span>, and the choler or passion of Mars:  <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span> therefore a desire either to <span class="reg">die</span> or be cured, if it be possible:  Amongst many <span class="reg">Physicians</span> one being found, who <span class="reg">undertook</span> this charge
                        
                        
                        
                        <span class="pb">9i</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 28.</span> upon <span class="reg">himself</span>, <span class="reg">he</span> was brought with <span class="reg">entreaties</span> and rewards: And this Allegory
                         is very frequent in the writings of the Philosophers, as of Bernard, Alanus, in the
                         treatise of Duenech, and innumerable others; <span class="reg">we</span> therefore add <span class="reg">no</span> other circumstances which might be derived from them: it is sufficient here to have observed, the excrement of which coction may be evacuated by balneation: for
                         herein consists the substance of the whole matter: Heat included in the body
                         is <span class="reg">commonly</span> reduced to the superficies of the <span class="reg">skin</span> together with the blood in
                         <span class="reg">hot</span> stoves or baths, whereby a <span class="reg">beautiful</span> complexion is acquired to the face  and whole body; which if it appear, will be a <span class="reg">sign</span>, that the <span class="reg">melancholic</span> 
         <span class="reg">blackness</span>, which infects the <span class="reg">skin</span>, may by degrees be evacuated, and all
                         the humors corrected, that pure and rosy blood may afterwards be generated: The whole temperament of his body must necessarily be amended,  because it resists good blood, and is cold and dry, that on the contrary being
                         <span class="reg">hot</span> and moist, which whether it can be done or <span class="reg">no</span>, it is convenient for
                         a <span class="reg">Physician</span> to foreknow and foretell by <span class="reg">prognostics</span>: Some men are found
                         who have taken Cerdon for the great Prince or Kings <span class="reg">Son</span>, but they have  at length by <span class="reg">certain</span> signs perceived what <span class="reg">he</span> was in descent and education: lest this should happen, the artist must be <span class="reg">careful</span> in the first place
                         to choose the true offspring of the King, which though <span class="reg">he</span> be not in splendid and golden attire, but in despicable and <span class="reg">mean</span>
         <span class="reg">clothing</span>, as <span class="reg">also</span> of a  livid and <span class="reg">melancholic</span> complexion, let him not therefore reject him, or  take another in his <span class="reg">room</span>; for if <span class="reg">he</span> be very well <span class="reg">washed</span>, his <span class="reg">royal</span> genius will <span class="reg">soon</span> appear, as in Cyrus, Paris, Romulus, who were educated  amongst <span class="reg">rustics</span>: But by way of observation the bath must be a <span class="reg">Laconicum</span>,  that is, vaporous and <span class="reg">sudorific</span>, that the water may not <span class="reg">burn</span> his tender flesh, or
                         obstruct the pores, whereby more damage than utility would ensue, and his malady
                         not be cured: As for the Kings garments to be put on after bathing let <span class="reg">no</span> man
                         be solicitous; for as the daughter of King Alcinous did in times past contribute  <span class="reg">clothes</span> to Ulysses being <span class="reg">shipwrecked</span> and naked, <span class="reg">so</span> will there be one that will  send him most <span class="reg">precious</span> robes, that <span class="reg">he</span> may deservedly be acknowledged the  <span class="reg">Son</span> of Sol . . . . . . . . . . . . .</div>
