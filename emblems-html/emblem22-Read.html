      <div class="ab"> As <span class="reg">Mercurial</span> Statues are <span class="reg">commonly</span> placed in roads where three <span class="reg">ways</span> meet, to<span class="milestone">e03-01</span>gether with a title and inscription, to guide <span class="reg">doubtful</span> travellers into the right
                         way, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> are <span class="reg">certain</span> acute sentences inferred in many of their books
                         and <span class="reg">volumes</span> of the Philosophers, here and there <span class="reg">allegorical</span> and dubious, that
                         the investigator of truth may thereby be admonished, and led as it were by
                         the hand into the right path: of these this <span class="reg">emblematical</span> inscription is one,
                         whereof this is accounted the meaning, that lead must be made of the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">brass</span>, and <span class="reg">tin</span> of lead, which by Geber is called white lead,
                         who <span class="reg">teaches</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span>, which way <span class="reg">Saturn</span> may by washing with Mercury be
                         converted into Jupiter; wherefore this index, though the speech of Battus,
                         must be credited, if at any time <span class="reg">he</span> discover the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> oxen,  what place they frequent, saying, they were in the mountains, and were  under those mountains: for many men, as Arnold in Novum lumen Chapt. 1.
                         <span class="reg">affirms</span>, <span class="reg">wandering</span> in the mountains <span class="reg">do</span> not know these <span class="reg">animals</span>: but they
                         are sold openly at a very small price: In the Summer <span class="reg">also</span> Snow is sometimes observed on the highest <span class="reg">mountains</span>, and clouds most <span class="reg">commonly</span>, by  which as by a <span class="reg">vapor</span> and water lead being <span class="reg">black</span> is washed, and turned into <span class="reg">whiteness</span>: but their <span class="reg">crystals</span> are found congealed and hardened by ice
                         in the lowest <span class="reg">valleys</span> and <span class="reg">mines</span>, together with Lapis Specularis, and <span class="reg">Talc</span> 
         <span class="reg">commended</span> for making the face white and <span class="reg">beautiful</span>, if an <span class="reg">oil</span> be made  thereof: But <span class="reg">chiefly</span> clear and running Mercury, which being well <span class="reg">prepared</span> 
         <span class="reg">rectifies</span> the blemishes of <span class="reg">Saturn</span>, and <span class="reg">advances</span> him into the throne of
                         Jupiter: but they ought not to be meant vulgar <span class="reg">Saturn</span> and Jupiter, because vulgar <span class="reg">metals</span> enter not into the <span class="reg">Physical</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span>, but as they are purged
                         and made <span class="reg">Physical</span> by long <span class="reg">preparation</span>: <span class="reg">Saturn</span> is the father of all the  gentiles, or rather golden things, and the first gate of secrets: With this, <span class="reg">Says</span> Rhasis in his Epistle, are the gates of Sciences opened: His <span class="reg">Son</span> Jupiter  Succeeds him, who <span class="reg">expels</span> his father out of his <span class="reg">kingdom</span>, and <span class="reg">dismembered</span> him,
                         that <span class="reg">he</span> might not beget more <span class="reg">Sons</span>; but Venus the most <span class="reg">beautiful</span> of women sprung from his testicles being cast into the Sea: From Jupiter, who is
                         <span class="reg">hot</span> lead <span class="reg">prepared</span>, are produced the other Planets, as Mars from Juno, Mercury from <span class="reg">Maia</span>, the daughter of Atlas as <span class="reg">mountain</span> of Mauritania,  Luna and Sol from Latona: which four are brought into the world by coction alone or womens <span class="reg">work</span>: but by coction, maturation and the dispersion
                         of the more crude parts is <span class="reg">signified</span>, which is <span class="reg">performed</span> by Vulcan in <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">vessels</span>: for its is not to be <span class="reg">supposed</span>, that it is vulgar coction, as to  the way of operating, but it agrees with it as to the end: For as a woman matures fish in water, that is, softens, <span class="reg">boils</span> and <span class="reg">sees</span> them, all the superfluous moisture being resolved from them into water and <span class="reg">air</span>, <span class="reg">So</span> the Philosopher handles
                         his subject, macerating, melting, dissolving, coagulating and fixing it in a peculiar water, which is stronger than the sharpest vinegar, in the <span class="reg">vessel</span> of Hermes, the <span class="reg">joints</span> of which are most exquisitely close, as is requisite, that the water may not exhale, and that, which is in the <span class="reg">vessel</span>, be burned: This is <span class="pb">73</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 22.</span> that <span class="reg">vessel</span> above the <span class="reg">vessel</span>, and the Philosophers <span class="reg">pot</span>, the Laconian bath,
                         in which the old man sweats: Some there are, who <span class="reg">boil</span> fish, Lobsters, Crabs,
                         or green Peas in a double, <span class="reg">so</span> that the <span class="reg">said</span> things are in the upper <span class="reg">pot</span>, and
                         water <span class="reg">only</span> in the lower, and the <span class="reg">pots</span> are placed one above the other with
                         <span class="reg">orbs</span>, that the <span class="reg">vapor</span> may not <span class="reg">go</span> forth: by which means the <span class="reg">vapor</span> of  the water ascending <span class="reg">only</span> penetrates and matures the things contained,  and makes them much more tender and soft, than if they had <span class="reg">boiled</span> in  water: This is the most laudable way of the Philosophers, whereby they
                         mollify that which is hard, dissolve that which is compact, and rarefy that
                         which is <span class="reg">thick</span>: For the <span class="reg">air</span> or insensible <span class="reg">vapor</span> is that which matures,  cocts, and perfects fruits in trees, not crude and cold water, as such: The  <span class="reg">air</span> is <span class="reg">also</span> that which <span class="reg">tinges</span> and <span class="reg">colors</span> the golden apples in the Orchards of the Hesperides: For, if it <span class="reg">we</span> well considered, the ebullition of
                         water, whereby raw flesh is cocted till it be <span class="reg">fit</span> to eat, is nothing <span class="reg">else</span>, but a rarefaction and transmutation of the water into an airy <span class="reg">vapor</span>, the bubbles
                         being <span class="reg">air</span>
         <span class="reg">contained</span> within the water, which <span class="reg">do</span> easily vanish away, the
                         <span class="reg">air</span> betaking <span class="reg">itself</span> from the water to its <span class="reg">own</span> Sphere, and the water  settling to its <span class="reg">own</span> center . . . . . . . . . .</div>
