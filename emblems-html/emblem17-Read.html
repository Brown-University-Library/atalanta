      <div class="ab"> The Philosophers have in many places made mention of four sorts of fire<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> necessary to the <span class="reg">natural</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span>, namely Lully, the Author of Scala, Ripley,
                         and many others: and to this end Raymund speaking of fires (<span class="reg">Says</span> Scala).
                         You must note, that here are contrary operations: because as the fire  against nature dissolves the Spirit of a fixed body into the water of a  cloud, and binds the body of a volatile spirit into a congealed earth, <span class="reg">so</span> 
         <span class="reg">contrariwise</span> the fire of nature <span class="reg">congeals</span> the dissolved spirit of a fixed
                         body into a globous earth, and resolves the fixed body of a volatile  Spirit by fire against nature, not into the water of a cloud, but into <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> water. Ripley speaks more clearly of these fires in gate 3. thus:
                         There are four sorts of fires, which you ought to know, the <span class="reg">natural</span>, <span class="reg">unnatural</span>, fire against nature, and <span class="reg">elemental</span>, which <span class="reg">kindles</span> wood: These
                         fires <span class="reg">we</span> use, and <span class="reg">no</span> more. Fire against nature ought to excruciate  <span class="reg">bodies</span>, that is the dragon, as I tell you, violently burning, as the fire of hell.
                         The fire of nature is the third menstruum, that fire is naturally in every
                         thing: Occasioned fire <span class="reg">we</span> call <span class="reg">unnatural</span>, as the heat of ashes and baths
                         to putrefy: Without these fires you can bring nothing to putrefaction, whereby your matter may be separated, that it may at once be proportioned  for a new conjunction: Make therefore a fire within in your <span class="reg">glass</span>, which
                         can <span class="reg">burn</span>
         <span class="reg">bodies</span> more effectually, than <span class="reg">elemental</span> fire: these are their
                         sayings. They are indeed called fires, because they have a fiery virtue,  the <span class="reg">natural</span> in coagulating, the <span class="reg">unnatural</span> in dissolving, the fire against
                         nature in corrupting, the <span class="reg">elemental</span> in <span class="reg">administering</span> the first heat and
                         motion: And there is a concatenated order observed in them, that the Second may be incited by the first, the third by the second, the fourth by
                         the third and first together to action, <span class="reg">so</span> as that one is the agent, and
                         the other the patient, and the same both agent and patient in different
                         respect: That which is observed in iron rings or pillars held together by a
                         Magnet, and <span class="reg">joined</span> by <span class="reg">mutual</span> contact, the same in these fires: for the
                         <span class="reg">elemental</span>
         <span class="reg">does</span> like the Magnet <span class="reg">emit</span> its virtue though the second
                         and third even to the fourth, and <span class="reg">joins</span> one to another by <span class="reg">mutual</span> operations, and <span class="reg">causes</span> them to <span class="reg">stick</span> together, till <span class="reg">internal</span> action be
                         effected amongst the uppermost: The first is <span class="reg">elemental</span> fire indeed  and name, the second is <span class="reg">air</span> or airy, the third <span class="reg">watery</span> or of a Lunar nature, the fourth earthy: It is <span class="reg">needless</span> to say any thing of the first,  because it is <span class="reg">known</span> to every mans eye and touch: The three other are
                         dragons, menstrua's, waters, Sulphurs, and <span class="reg">Mercuries</span>: Dragons, because  being participants of venenosity, they <span class="reg">devour</span> serpents of their <span class="reg">own</span> kind, frett and alter, that is, dissolve and coagulate <span class="reg">bodies</span> incorporated  and mixed with them: They are called Menstrua's, because the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> infant is produced from them, and nourished therewith even to
                         its nativity: Lully in his <span class="reg">book</span> of the Quintessence, dist. 3. <span class="reg">has</span> two <span class="pb">58</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 17.</span> Menstruums, the vegetable, and <span class="reg">mineral</span>, Ripley in his <span class="reg">Preface</span> of the gates <span class="reg">has</span> three, which are really one and <span class="reg">do</span> agree: for the generation of the infant
                         is made of them <span class="reg">altogether</span>, and a white water <span class="reg">preceeds</span> the birth of it, which
                         is not of the substance but superfluity of the infant, and therefore to be  separated: They are waters, because in fire they <span class="reg">Show</span> a <span class="reg">watery</span> nature, that
                         is, flowing and liquidity, which agrees with water: Manifest it is that the  <span class="reg">properties</span> of waters are different and <span class="reg">wonderful</span>, whereof some <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">petrify</span>, being coagulated into very hard stones <span class="reg">fit</span> for building: Very like these are the  Philosophers <span class="reg">mineral</span> waters, which <span class="reg">do</span> condense, and <span class="reg">turn</span> into a stony consistence: They are <span class="reg">also</span> called Sulphurs because of the virtue of Sulphur,  which they comprehend in them, for the Sulphur of nature is mixed and  made one with the other Sulphur, and the two Sulphurs are dissolved by one,
                         and one is separated from two, and the Sulphurs are <span class="reg">preserved</span> and contained
                         by Sulphurs, as Yximidius in Turba <span class="reg">says</span>: Now what Sulphurs are Dardaris
                         there declares in these words: Sulphurs are Souls hidden in the <span class="reg">four</span> elements,
                         which being extracted by art <span class="reg">do</span> naturally <span class="reg">contain</span> one another and are  <span class="reg">joined</span> together: if you can by water <span class="reg">govern</span> and purify well that which  is hidden in the belly of Sulphur, that hidden thing meeting with its <span class="reg">own</span> nature <span class="reg">rejoices</span>, even as water with its like. I will now tell you (<span class="reg">Says</span> Mosius
                         <span class="reg">also</span>) what it is: the first <span class="reg">in deed</span>, which is fiery Argent vive, the second, the  body compounded in it, and the third is the water of Sulphur, by which the
                         first is <span class="reg">washed</span>, and dilacerated, and governed, till the <span class="reg">work</span> be accomplished:
                         That which is <span class="reg">said</span> of Sulphurs, the same may be understood of <span class="reg">so</span> many <span class="reg">Mercuries</span>: For this <span class="reg">says</span> the same Mosius afterwards: Argent vive
                         Cambar is the Magnesia, but Argent vive or Auripigment is that Sulphur
                         which ascends from a <span class="reg">mixed</span> compound: But I will <span class="reg">omit</span> the inference of
                         more <span class="reg">testimonies</span>, they being infinite and obvious to every man: These <span class="reg">four</span> fires are included as it were in Spheres and <span class="reg">orbs</span>, that is, every one <span class="reg">has</span> a
                         particular center, from which or to which their motion tends, but <span class="reg">nevertheless</span> they are kept <span class="reg">so</span> bound together partly by nature, partly by art, that one
                         can operate little or nothing without another, yea the action of one is the
                         passion of another, and on the contrary . . . . . . .</div>
