         <span class="reg">we</span> have <span class="reg">elsewhere</span> (namely in the first<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> 
         <span class="reg">book</span> of <span class="reg">Hieroglyphics</span>) reduced to its true <span class="reg">original</span>, which is
                         <span class="reg">Chymical</span>, and fully <span class="reg">explained</span> it: Wherefore here to repeat the
                         same things (though the same things ought to be spoken of the  same things) <span class="reg">we</span> judge superfluous: but <span class="reg">nevertheless</span>
         <span class="reg">we</span> will
                         here <span class="reg">form</span> a <span class="reg">parallel</span> discourse, which will <span class="reg">always</span> be and <span class="reg">remain</span> within the prisons of that ancient <span class="reg">Chemia</span>, which is solely
                         decanted and decipered by the <span class="reg">Poets</span>: Will you <span class="reg">persuade</span>
         <span class="reg">me</span> that <span class="reg">Osiris</span> was a God, or King of the <span class="reg">Egyptians</span>? I will not <span class="reg">believe</span>, though you <span class="reg">persuade</span>
         <span class="reg">me</span> to <span class="reg">believe</span>; For <span class="reg">dogs</span> (as it is in  the Proverb) smell <span class="reg">far</span> otherwise, <span class="reg">far</span> otherwise Swine: I <span class="reg">do</span> plainly deny him to be a God, and you will ascent to <span class="reg">me</span>, <span class="reg">unless</span> you be a heathen, or of an opinion contradictory to right reason:
                         And that <span class="reg">he</span> was <span class="reg">no</span> King, is demonstrated by all the circumstances which are <span class="reg">elsewhere</span> considered: The <span class="reg">Sun</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> is, but  <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>, the name of which being in many authors often attributed to it, the vulgar, who know <span class="reg">no</span> other light but that of the  world, have interpreted for it. The Philosophers <span class="reg">Sun</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span> denomination from the <span class="reg">Sun</span> of the world, because it contains the <span class="reg">properties</span> of nature descending from that <span class="reg">celestial</span>
         <span class="reg">Sun</span>, or <span class="reg">agreeable</span> to it: <span class="reg">Osiris</span> therefore, Dionysus, Bacchus, Jupiter, Mars, Adonis, <span class="reg">Oedipus</span>, Perseus, Achilles, Triptolemus, Pelops, Hippomenes, and Pollux are the <span class="reg">Sun</span>: but  Isis, Juno, Venus, the mother of <span class="reg">Oedipus</span>, DanaÃ«, Deidamia, Atalanta,
                         Helena, the <span class="reg">Moon</span>; as <span class="reg">also</span> Latona, Semele, Europa, Leda, Antiope  Thalia. And these are the parts of the compound, which before operation is called Stone, and by the name of every <span class="reg">metal</span>, Magnesia:  After operation, Orcus, Pyrrhus, Apollo, <span class="reg">Aesculapius</span>. The adjuncts are  Typhon, Python, the Boar: The Artists are Hercules, <span class="reg">Ulysses</span>, Jason,  Theseus, Pyrithous: The <span class="reg">labors</span> and <span class="reg">perils</span>, which were undergone by
                         these artists, are innumerable: The <span class="reg">labors</span> of Hercules, the <span class="reg">errors</span> of
                         Ulysses, the <span class="reg">perils</span> of Jason, the attempts of Theseus, and the remora's of
                         Pyrithous may be seen: This is the great volume of matter and doctrine, through which in every page Vulcan, Mercury, and <span class="reg">Saturn</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> 
         <span class="reg">run</span> backwards and forwards, the first, as the father and cause of all,

                         the third, as the efficient. Sol takes his sister Luna to wife: Jupiter Juno,
                         as <span class="reg">Saturn</span> Rhea, and <span class="reg">Osiris</span> Isis: Dionysus is <span class="reg">ripped</span> out of his mother Semele being burnt by the <span class="reg">lightning</span> of Jove to be matured in the  thigh of Jupiter his father, <span class="reg">Aesculapius</span> out of Coronis his Mother: Dionysus coming to maturity <span class="reg">shows</span> men a new way of drinking wine, undertaking an expedition even to the <span class="reg">Indies</span>; <span class="reg">Osiris</span> and Triptolemus,

         <span class="reg">killed</span> his father

                         <span class="reg">Osiris</span> was <span class="reg">cut</span> in <span class="reg">pieces</span>, and <span class="reg">joined</span> together <span class="reg">again</span> by Isis his mother,

                         eaten by Ceres, and <span class="reg">again</span>
         <span class="reg">restored</span> to life, an ivory shoulder being added:
                         Achilles and Triptolemus were put under coals of fire by night, and in

                         Achilles descended, the apple of Eris, the first cause of the rape of  Helena, was <span class="reg">thrown</span> about. Pollux was with the Argonauts, who (if they
                         lived) are <span class="reg">presupposed</span> to have lived near fifty years before the <span class="reg">beginning</span> of the <span class="reg">Trojan</span>
         <span class="reg">war</span>, and Helena with Pollux came both
                         out of one <span class="reg">egg</span>; Helena therefore was an old woman when she was
                         <span class="reg">ravished</span> by Paris: Medea was <span class="reg">married</span> to Achilles in the Elysian <span class="reg">fields</span>,
                         then an old <span class="reg">toothless</span> woman: <span class="reg">unless</span> perhaps <span class="reg">She</span> restored youth to

                         the head of Medusa, to <span class="reg">whom</span> Mercury gave a <span class="reg">Scimitar</span>, and
