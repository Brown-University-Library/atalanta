         <span class="milestone">e50-01</span>The mansion of Dragons is in caverns of the earth, but the residence  of men above the earth in the <span class="reg">immediate</span>
         <span class="reg">air</span>; which two Elements
                         are contrary, and appointed by the Philosophers to be <span class="reg">joined</span> together,
                         that one may act upon the other: <span class="milestone">e50-02</span>But by the woman others <span class="reg">mean</span>, as
                         <span class="reg">Basil</span> in Key 2d. <span class="reg">says</span>: For it is not convenient or <span class="reg">commodious</span> for an  Eagle to place her nest upon the Alps, because her chickens would <span class="reg">die</span> through the <span class="reg">coldness</span> of the Snow at the top of the mountains: <span class="milestone">e50-03</span>But
                         if you add to the Eagle a cold Dragon, which <span class="reg">has</span> had his habitation
                         a long time in the rocks, and crept out of the caves of the earth,  and put them both into an <span class="reg">infernal</span>
         <span class="reg">cell</span>, then will Pluto blow a  blast, and draw a volatile fiery spirit out of the cold dragon, which
                         with its great heat will <span class="reg">burn</span> the Eagles feathers, and excite such a
                         <span class="reg">sudorific</span> bath, as to melt the Snow at the top of the mountains, 
			 lb/&gt;and turn it into water; from which a miserable bath may be well  <span class="reg">prepared</span>, contributing fortune and health to the King. <span class="milestone">e50-04</span>Admirable indeed it is, that a cold dragon should <span class="reg">yield</span> a fiery Spirit; yet experience  declares it to be true in burned serpents, which <span class="reg">do</span> send forth a venomous  flame <span class="reg">poisoning</span> the standers by: <span class="milestone">e50-05</span>Nor in <span class="reg">vain</span> are the keepers of the <span class="reg">Chymical</span> treasures called flammivomous dragons, as the keepers of the golden
                         fleece, the Hesperian gardens, Cadmus, and the like. <span class="milestone">e50-06</span>But this dragon lives
                         in <span class="reg">straight</span> places of subterranean rocks, which you must there take, and
                         <span class="reg">join</span> to the Eagle or woman, to her, in the grave, to the other, if you  had rather, in the nest: For the nature of a dragon is sometimes to <span class="reg">lie</span> in
                         <span class="reg">wait</span> for the Eagles eggs, and wage <span class="reg">mortal</span>
         <span class="reg">war</span> with the Eagle: <span class="milestone">e50-07</span>Some
                         there are of the <span class="reg">Grecian</span> writers who <span class="reg">affirm</span> that a dragon in times past  fell in love with a <span class="reg">maid</span> and lay with her. What wonder therefore, if
                         the Philosophers would have their dragon <span class="reg">shut</span> up in a <span class="reg">cavern</span> with a  woman? <span class="milestone">e50-08</span>Greverus <span class="reg">joins</span> red and <span class="reg">black</span> dragons together in the deep  <span class="reg">gulf</span> of the <span class="reg">mountain</span>, and <span class="reg">burns</span> them with fire, and the <span class="reg">black</span> perishing, <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">says</span> that the keeper of the <span class="reg">mountain</span>
         <span class="reg">searchs</span> for them
                         every where, and brings them to the <span class="reg">mountain</span>. <span class="milestone">e50-09</span>Merlin in his vision (if it
                         be not suppositious) makes mention of a white and red dragon; These
                         Dragons, whatsoever they be, whether one be a woman, or a female  dragon, <span class="reg">do</span> act one with the other, till they both <span class="reg">die</span>, and <span class="reg">emit</span> blood
                         from their wounds, wherewith they are <span class="reg">imbrued</span>. But here the element
                         of earth and fire is understood by the dragon, and by the woman the
                         element of <span class="reg">air</span> and water; <span class="milestone">e50-10</span>whereupon <span class="reg">says</span> Clangor buccin√¶: The Dragon
                         is the matter remaining in the <span class="reg">bottom</span> after the water be <span class="reg">distilled</span> from
                         it: <span class="milestone">e50-11</span>And according to Hermes: The water of <span class="reg">air</span> being between heaven and
                         earth is the life of every thing, for that water dissolves a body into a <span class="pb">157</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 50.</span> spirit, and <span class="reg">vivifies</span> a dead thing, and makes matrimony between man and woman: For it <span class="reg">confers</span> the whole <span class="reg">benefit</span> of the art: <span class="milestone">e50-12</span>Of the earth <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> thus
                         speaks. And moreover understand, that the particular earth, which <span class="reg">we</span> tread
                         upon, is not the true element, <span class="reg">yes</span> is elemented with its true fifth element: Nor
                         <span class="reg">does</span> the fifth <span class="reg">elemental</span> substance recede from its elemented body, of which
                         the earth is formed. <span class="milestone">e50-13</span>And a little after. But the Virgin and true element,  which fire cannot <span class="reg">burn</span>, is in the center of the earth: This is the dragon,
                         whereof <span class="reg">we</span>
         <span class="reg">speak</span>, insinuating <span class="reg">itself</span> even into the center of the earth,
                         where the heat being great, it conceives within <span class="reg">itself</span> a flaming heat, wherewith it <span class="reg">burns</span> the woman or eagle. <span class="milestone">e50-14</span>The woman or eagle is indeed an airy  water, which some call the white or <span class="reg">celestial</span> eagle, and will have it made
                         of <span class="reg">common</span> Mercury, or sublimed Salts, following therein the sense of some <span class="reg">certain</span> men blind in this art, <span class="reg">feigning</span> themselves to be quicksighted; <span class="milestone">e50-15</span>But  <span class="reg">says</span> Count Bernhard in his Epistle, I tell you <span class="reg">truly</span>, that <span class="reg">no</span> water dissolves
                         a <span class="reg">metallic</span> species by <span class="reg">natural</span> reduction, except that which continues with  it in matter and <span class="reg">form</span>, and which the <span class="reg">metals</span> themselves can <span class="reg">recongeal</span>:  <span class="milestone">e50-16</span>And a little after: Nor <span class="reg">does</span> that water <span class="reg">appertain</span> to <span class="reg">bodies</span> in solutions, which
                         remains not with them in congelations: <span class="milestone">e50-17</span>And a little after: I tell you <span class="reg">truly</span>,
                         that the <span class="reg">oil</span> which naturally incerates and <span class="reg">joins</span> natures together, and naturally <span class="reg">introduces</span> a Medicine for the tinging of other <span class="reg">bodies</span>, is not compounded
                         of any other extraneous thing, but <span class="reg">only</span> of the <span class="reg">bowels</span> of the body which is
                         to be dissolved: <span class="milestone">e50-18</span>This therefore being apprehended, the eagle and woman, as
                         <span class="reg">also</span> the Dragon with the secrets of <span class="reg">almost</span> the whole art are understood,  which perhaps <span class="reg">we</span> have thus <span class="reg">far</span> too openly explained and declared to
                         the <span class="reg">Sons</span> of learning, that God may hereby be <span class="reg">glorified</span>. . . . .</div>
