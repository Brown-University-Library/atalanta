      <div class="ab"> The opinion or flattery of men attributes <span class="reg">wonderful</span> births to some <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> persons above others, but certainly fabulous, as to Alexander the great,
                         begotten not by Philip King of Macedonia, but Jupiter Hammon; to  Romulus and Remus, by Mars; to Plato, <span class="reg">born</span> of the virgin Perictione
                         violated by the image of Apollo: <span class="reg">so</span> the Heathen would demonstrate
                         themselves to proceed from the Gods, as <span class="reg">also</span> Thessalus the <span class="reg">Son</span> of Hippocrates the <span class="reg">Physician</span>
         <span class="reg">does</span> amongst other things <span class="reg">endeavor</span> to <span class="reg">persuade</span> 
         <span class="reg">himself</span> to descend from Apollo at Athens: but <span class="reg">we</span> cannot easily <span class="reg">believe</span> them, who know, that they were neither men nor Gods, to <span class="reg">whom</span> they
                         <span class="reg">refer</span> the <span class="reg">original</span> of their lineage: And if the Heroes were amongst
                         men as divine, <span class="reg">we</span> conceive all those magnificent actions boasted in  the world, through the adulation of Subjects, disciples, or others, were things
                         <span class="reg">feigned</span> of them, and insinuated into the opinion of the vulgar by  forged writings: The thing is different, that the Philosophers ascribe an <span class="reg">unsual</span> conception and nativity to their <span class="reg">Son</span>; for <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span> something peculiar  above all other things <span class="reg">born</span> in the world, <span class="reg">he</span> being <span class="reg">conceived</span> in baths, and
                         <span class="reg">born</span> in the <span class="reg">air</span>. <span class="reg">We</span> know that women being barren through overmuch
                         <span class="reg">coldness</span> and siccity may be much helped by <span class="reg">hot</span> baths, <span class="reg">so</span> as to be made
                         able and <span class="reg">fit</span> for conception, but that it should be done in baths is a thing
                         unheard of: that seems to <span class="reg">appertain</span> to him alone, by reason of the <span class="reg">wonderful</span> power of nature <span class="reg">far</span> different from other things. they <span class="reg">elsewhere</span> say,
                         that <span class="reg">he</span> must be <span class="reg">conceived</span> in the <span class="reg">bottom</span> of the <span class="reg">vessel</span>, and <span class="reg">born</span> in the  <span class="reg">Alembic</span>: which opinion is more conspicuous: For the waters of baths, if  there be any, will not be at the top, nor in the <span class="reg">middle</span>, but in the <span class="reg">bottom</span> of
                         the <span class="reg">vessel</span>, and in the <span class="reg">Alembic</span> are airy <span class="reg">vapors</span>: where therefore conception is made, <span class="reg">he</span> ascends into the <span class="reg">Alembic</span>, and his birth appears in a
                         white <span class="reg">color</span>: <span class="reg">Blackness</span> rules in the <span class="reg">bottom</span>, concerning which <span class="reg">says</span> the
                         Rosary; Conception is, when the earth is dissolved into a <span class="reg">black</span>
         <span class="reg">powder</span>, and
                         begins to <span class="reg">retain</span> somewhat of the Mercury; for then the male acts upon
                         the female, that is, Azoth upon the earth. And a little after: Conception  and desponsation is made in putrefaction in the <span class="reg">bottom</span> of the <span class="reg">vessel</span>,
                         and the generation of things generated will be made in the <span class="reg">air</span>, to <span class="reg">wit</span>,
                         in the head of the <span class="reg">vessel</span>, that is, the <span class="reg">Alembic</span>: And conception in
                         baths is nothing <span class="reg">else</span> but putrefaction in dung: for <span class="reg">so</span> the same Rosary
                         <span class="reg">continues</span>: The body <span class="reg">does</span> nothing, <span class="reg">unless</span> it be <span class="reg">putrified</span>, and it cannot
                         be <span class="reg">putrefied</span>, except with Mercury: And <span class="reg">soon</span> after: Putrefaction must
                         be effected with a most gentle heat of <span class="reg">warm</span> and moist dung, and by
                         <span class="reg">no</span> other thing, <span class="reg">so</span> that nothing ascend, because if any thing should
                         ascend, there would be a separation of the parts, which ought not to be,
                         till the male and female be perfectly <span class="reg">joined</span> together, and one receive the other, the <span class="reg">sign</span> of which perfect solution is <span class="reg">blackness</span> in  the superficies. His birth is white, which is consummated at the top

         <span class="fw">Discourse 34.</span> of mountains, that is, in the <span class="reg">air</span> or <span class="reg">Alembic</span>; which is by Rosinus to
                         Euthicia thus explained: The wise man <span class="reg">said</span>. Take things out of their
                         <span class="reg">mines</span>, and exalt them to higher places, and send them from the top
                         of their mountains, and reduce them to their roots: And afterwards: But
                         by mountains <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">signified</span> Cucurbits, and by the tops of mountains
                         <span class="reg">Alembic</span>: and to send is according to similitude to receive the water
                         of them by an <span class="reg">Alembic</span> in a Receiver: and to reduce to the roots, is to
                         that, from which they proceed: and <span class="reg">he</span> named Cucurbits mountains,
                         because Sol and Luna are found in mountains: <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> in the mountains, which are Cucurbits, are their Sol and Luna generated: These
                         are his words: Afterwards <span class="reg">he</span> becomes red, and begins to <span class="reg">go</span> upon the
                         waters, that is, upon <span class="reg">metals</span> melted by fire, which stand in the <span class="reg">form</span> of a <span class="reg">mercurial</span> water: For <span class="reg">he</span> is the lord of waters, upon which
                         <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">exercises</span> authority, as Neptune, and is the king of the Sea,
                         and the possessor of mountains. Of Xerxes King of Persia they  report, that being upon an expedition into Greece, <span class="reg">he</span> sent an  embassy to the Sea, and to the <span class="reg">mountain</span> Athos, that they would
                         <span class="reg">do</span> him <span class="reg">no</span> wrong, that by the force of waves, this of fire, otherwise that <span class="reg">he</span> would take revenge upon them both: But the tale  was told to them that were <span class="reg">deaf</span>, and the Sea drowned some of his
                         ships, and Athos <span class="reg">destroyed</span> not a few by fire. Hereupon the King being angry, did, as lord fo the Sea and mountains, <span class="reg">command</span> a <span class="reg">certain</span> number of stripes to be inflicted upon the first, and a great
                         part of the <span class="reg">mountain</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> cast into the sea: but these things <span class="reg">do</span> demonstrate the <span class="reg">rashness</span> rather than the prudence of <span class="reg">so</span> great a
                         king: <span class="reg">He</span>, of <span class="reg">whom</span>
         <span class="reg">we</span>
         <span class="reg">speak</span>, <span class="reg">purges</span> all waters from obstacles;  and <span class="reg">impurities</span>, not by edict, but fact, and freely <span class="reg">passes</span> through them,
                         which <span class="reg">also</span> (which is more) <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">congeals</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> as by their <span class="reg">hardness</span> to
                         bear his chariots, in which ships <span class="reg">sailed</span> before: <span class="reg">He</span> makes mountains
                         <span class="reg">equal</span> with <span class="reg">valleys</span>, and fears not the flames of fire, and therefore
                         goes freely wheresoever <span class="reg">he</span> please, from the pillars of Hercules in
                         the farthest parts of India, to the pillars of Dionysius . . . .</div>
