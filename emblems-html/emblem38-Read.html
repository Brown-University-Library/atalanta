      <div class="ab"> Socrates being demanded what Country man <span class="reg">he</span> was, answered a <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> Citizen of the world: by which his intention was to signify, that though
                         <span class="reg">he</span> was <span class="reg">born</span> at Athens as to person, yet in mind <span class="reg">he</span> freely beheld  the whole world, as his Country, and the things therein contained,  the whole earth being a wise mans Country, where <span class="reg">he</span> lives well:  <span class="reg">So</span> if any one <span class="reg">ask</span> the Philosophers what Countryman their  Hermaphrodite is, they answer, <span class="reg">he</span> belongs to the world, or is in all  corners of the world, where the Elements can be found, as the <span class="reg">Son</span> of the wise, who <span class="reg">has</span> a country <span class="reg">common</span> with them: But <span class="reg">seeing</span> that
                         it happens not that any man is <span class="reg">born</span> twice or oftener, nor first enters
                         this light in <span class="reg">several</span> but in one place, as Socrates is owned to be an  Athenian, <span class="reg">so</span> is Rebis reputed an inhabiter of two mountains, that is,
                         Mercury and Venus, from whence <span class="reg">also</span> the name of Hermaphrodite  given him by both parents; a noble and large country is indeed <span class="reg">no</span> small <span class="reg">help</span> to <span class="reg">do</span> things excellently well, in which Citizens are <span class="reg">preferred</span> before <span class="reg">foreigners</span>, and promoted to <span class="reg">public</span> offices, that they
                         may not <span class="reg">lie</span> in obscurity (as it happens in a <span class="reg">mean</span> place, and <span class="reg">so</span> something of light come to them from the country) but <span class="reg">Show</span> themselves rather with their <span class="reg">own</span> virtues, even in the small <span class="reg">affairs</span> of
                         a house, and give light themselves to their <span class="reg">own</span> country: After this
                         manner these mountains <span class="reg">unknown</span> to many men <span class="reg">do</span> acquire fame
                         from the Hermaphrodite by reason of his illustrious actions, and name
                         famous throughout the whole world. For who though never <span class="reg">so</span> little versed in the Philosophers <span class="reg">books</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span> not <span class="reg">known</span> Rebis?  Who <span class="reg">has</span> not seen or beheld <span class="reg">Androgynous</span> with two heads? <span class="reg">He</span> verily
                         has been <span class="reg">known</span> to the <span class="reg">Indies</span> themselves, and his fame <span class="reg">has</span> been  dispersed farther, than the fame even of King Alexander: Many  men <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">travel</span> out of <span class="reg">far</span>
         <span class="reg">countries</span> to see and discourse some
                         learned man, or otherwise <span class="reg">remarkable</span> for singular military industry, art or science, but many more will betake themselves to  the <span class="reg">said</span> Mountains of Rebis, provided they can <span class="reg">learn</span> where  they may be found: With how great study and care did Morienus  being departed from Rome <span class="reg">seek</span> and at length find Adferus Alexandrinus, <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">himself</span> declares in his <span class="reg">book</span>, and therefore was to be  esteemed more happy, and acceptable to God, in that <span class="reg">he</span> had from a  living teacher, and not from <span class="reg">dumb</span> masters learnt, and beheld this
                         thing, that is, the native place of Rebis; <span class="reg">no</span>
         <span class="reg">less</span> assiduity and  diligence ought they to use, who <span class="reg">seek</span> the country of Rebis by  themselves, being informed by reason, and the documents of books:
                         But though some books may sometimes seem to be clear and conspi

         <span class="reg">veiled</span> and clouded with intricacy and obscurity, that by reason thereof it is very difficult to make distinction:
                         Wherefore <span class="reg">we</span> must cautiously proceed with them, that they, which are
                         <span class="reg">prepared</span> for remedy, may not be usd for <span class="reg">poison</span>: They are certainly  a vast ocean, in which expert mariners <span class="reg">sailing</span> may by <span class="reg">Astronomical</span> instruments know the latitude, or elevation of the <span class="reg">Equator</span> above
                         the Horizon, the Magnet <span class="reg">Showing</span> the North pole, but by <span class="reg">no</span> means
                         the longitude, or how great an <span class="reg">internal</span> of degrees they are distant  from the first Meridian, which is next to the fortunate Islands; <span class="reg">so</span> that they are <span class="reg">uncertain</span> in what place they may be between west  and east: What therefore is here to be done? That which the same  Mariners use to <span class="reg">do</span>, consult experience with reason, and thereby  <span class="reg">learn</span> how to determine a long voyage by particular signs, <span class="reg">promontories</span>, Islands, and other things, that they may not for want of consideration fall upon Sands and rocks: But here is <span class="reg">less</span> danger, if the
                         thing prosper not, but if <span class="reg">so</span>, greater <span class="reg">gain</span>, than there, where goods  and life are lost in an <span class="reg">hour</span>: But the <span class="reg">mountain</span> of the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> Mercury is not Nonacris, nor Atlas, where sometimes it is reported
                         to be brought forth, but Parnassus with two tops, in one of which  Hermes, in the other Venus resides: Here <span class="reg">also</span> is Apollo with the Muses, and Hippocrene, the <span class="reg">fountain</span> of Pegasus, with <span class="reg">laurel</span>
         <span class="reg">always</span> green: it is one <span class="reg">mountain</span> by name, but really two, as Hermaphroditus is beheld with two heads, and two members in one body: But  what man of a thousand persists in ascending to the top of this  <span class="reg">mountain</span>? Who dos not begin to <span class="reg">hesitate</span> at the <span class="reg">bottom</span> being  impeded by I know not what obstacles? Whoever attaines to the  <span class="reg">middle</span> of it? for
