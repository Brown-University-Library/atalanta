         <span class="milestone">e42-01</span>The chances, which may happen to <span class="reg">travelers</span>, are innumerable, especially if they take a journey on foot by night through slippery  and dangerous places; to which four things are requisite as <span class="reg">chiefly</span> necessary, not to <span class="reg">speak</span> of the victuals provided, and a strong  body: <span class="milestone">e42-02</span>In the first place, a companion or guide not ignorant of the
                         <span class="reg">ways</span>, through which <span class="reg">he</span> must <span class="reg">pass</span>: For if one ignorant man  guide another, the same thing happens to them as to blind men, if
                         they <span class="reg">do</span> not both fall headlong into a <span class="reg">ditch</span>, yet into <span class="reg">errors</span> and  mistakes: <span class="milestone">e42-03</span>Secondly, a <span class="reg">Staff</span>, by which the <span class="reg">slipperiness</span> and <span class="reg">peril</span> of the way, lest it be <span class="reg">detrimental</span> to a man, may be <span class="reg">avoided</span>: <span class="milestone">e42-04</span>Thirdly, sound eyes, for such journeys are most dangerous to the blind or
                         <span class="reg">dim</span> sighted: <span class="milestone">e42-05</span>Fourthly, a lamp or lighted torch, that the <span class="reg">diversities</span> and differences of the <span class="reg">ways</span> may be discerned. <span class="milestone">e42-06</span>After the same  manner if a man expose <span class="reg">himself</span> to a most difficult journey in
                         pursuit of the <span class="reg">Philosophic</span> medicine, <span class="reg">he</span> will, besides charge  and strength of body, desire four things exactly <span class="reg">parallel</span> and correspondent to those <span class="reg">aforesaid</span>, to <span class="reg">wit</span>, Nature, Reason, experience,
                         and reading: whereof if any one be wanting, the rest will <span class="reg">do</span> little or <span class="reg">no</span> good at all: <span class="milestone">e42-07</span>For by these, as by four <span class="reg">wheels</span>, the <span class="reg">Philosophic</span> chariot moves, to which one of the <span class="reg">wheels</span> cannot be  wanting, if it be left, it <span class="reg">avails</span> nothing. <span class="milestone">e42-08</span>Nature <span class="reg">presupposes</span>
         <span class="reg">natural</span>
         <span class="reg">bodies</span> and Spirits, as subjects first <span class="reg">ministered</span> by nature, upon
                         which art must afterwards act, <span class="reg">preparing</span>, purifying, and fitting it,
                         that thereof may be made that, which art <span class="reg">promises</span> for the end:
                         <span class="milestone">e42-09</span>
         <span class="reg">So</span> a Potter takes water and earth, a Glassemaker ashes and  Sand, a Smith iron, copper, <span class="reg">tin</span>, lead, Silver or gold, a Tanner
                         raw hides, and <span class="reg">so</span> other men other things: Such respect <span class="reg">also</span> 
         <span class="reg">has</span> the operator of Chymistry to his <span class="reg">materials</span>: <span class="milestone">e42-10</span>Their <span class="reg">materials</span> are to them very well <span class="reg">known</span> even the first day, <span class="reg">he</span>, when
                         <span class="reg">he</span> begins, continues for the most part ignorant of his for many
                         years, I will not say, during his whole life. <span class="milestone">e42-11</span>Nature <span class="reg">does</span> indeed  point at the matters, but there are many things, which obscure the  impression of nature, that it cannot be <span class="reg">known</span>. <span class="milestone">e42-12</span>The first intention  therefore is, seriously to contemplate how nature proceeds in her operations to the end that the <span class="reg">natural</span> subjects of Chymistry may  without defect or superfluity be had: Wherefore Nature must be  the guide and companion of <span class="reg">so</span> great a journey, whose footsteps  must be traced. <span class="milestone">e42-13</span>Secondly, reason must be as a <span class="reg">staff</span> to keep the  steps and feet steady and <span class="reg">firm</span>, that they may not slip or waver,
                         For without the exercise of reason a man will be apt to fall <span class="pb">133</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 42.</span> into <span class="reg">errors</span>, and therefore say the Philosophers; Whatsoever you hear,
                         consult with reason, whether it can be <span class="reg">so</span>, or <span class="reg">no</span>: <span class="milestone">e42-14</span>For <span class="reg">no</span> man is
                         forced to <span class="reg">believe</span> or <span class="reg">perform</span> things impossible, except <span class="reg">he</span> be of  <span class="reg">weak</span> memory, dull genius, and foolish imagination to impose upon
                         <span class="reg">himself</span> accepting things false for true, and rejecting true for false:
                         <span class="milestone">e42-15</span>They say <span class="reg">also</span> that they care not for words, whatsoever may be  spoken, but <span class="reg">only</span> for things, what may be understood; And that
                         words are for things, and not things for words: <span class="milestone">e42-16</span>As for example, Suppose
                         a man say that <span class="reg">glass</span> is made malleable by the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> tincture; Why Shall not I <span class="reg">believe</span> it, if provided reason dictates it?  <span class="milestone">e42-17</span>Thirdly, Experience will be as Spectacles, by which things may be  seen at a distance; These are <span class="reg">optic</span> instruments, invented and made
                         by art, to <span class="reg">help</span> and amend the <span class="reg">weakness</span> of mens eyes. <span class="milestone">e42-18</span>Much like to
                         these are experiments about the <span class="reg">mineral</span> matter of every kind <span class="reg">tried</span>,
                         seen or <span class="reg">truly</span> heard, which the more they are in memory, the more
                         will a man of reason draw from thence, and compare them among  and with other things, that <span class="reg">he</span> may perceive, what is true, what not.  <span class="milestone">e42-19</span>Fourthly, Reading <span class="reg">does</span> as it were kindle a clear lamp in the understanding, without which there will be every where <span class="reg">darkness</span> and <span class="reg">thick</span> clouds. <span class="milestone">e42-20</span>But the reading of good authors ought to be often repeated,  otherwise it will not be at all <span class="reg">effectual</span>. <span class="milestone">e42-21</span>Hereupon Bacasser in Turba
                         <span class="reg">says</span>: <span class="reg">He</span> therefore, that is of an even temper, and <span class="reg">exercises</span> patience without <span class="reg">regret</span>, will <span class="reg">attain</span> to this art as by a direct line, but
                         <span class="reg">he</span>, that thinks <span class="reg">himself</span> able sooner to reap benefit from our books,
                         is deceived, and it had been better not to have <span class="reg">looked</span> therein, than  ever to have <span class="reg">touched</span> them: And <span class="reg">so</span> on . . . . . .</div>
