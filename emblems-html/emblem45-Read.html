      <div class="ab"> As in a round or <span class="reg">Spherical</span> Palace, a fire kindled in one place illustrates<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> the parts above and below round about all the walls, except those, where
                         a table or the like standing in the <span class="reg">middle</span> may by its objection and interposition impede, and <span class="reg">admit</span> a <span class="reg">dark</span> shadow; <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> the <span class="reg">Sun</span> being  placed in that great Palace or carved theater of the heaven <span class="reg">does</span> by its  <span class="reg">rays</span> illuminate every concavity of heaven, the <span class="reg">bodies</span>
         <span class="reg">contained</span> therein
                         which are diaphanous and receptive of light, that is, all <span class="reg">stars</span> whatsoever
                         both <span class="reg">erratic</span> and fixed, except where the density of the earth in the  <span class="reg">middle</span> may prohibit: For there a <span class="reg">black</span> and <span class="reg">dark</span> shadow, which is called
                         night, continues <span class="reg">so</span> long, till it be driven away by the <span class="reg">presence</span> of  the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, and light established and made conspicuous in stead thereof:
                         A shadow therefore and night is the privation or absence (as day on the  contrary is the irradiation and circumfusion) of the Solar light. A shadow
                         is that which cannot endure the aspect of the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, and therefore  <span class="reg">avoids</span> and absconds <span class="reg">itself</span> sometimes in this sometimes in that part of
                         the earth, as the <span class="reg">Sun</span> is in opposition. The <span class="reg">Sun</span> and shadow never
                         saw themselves together, though, if nature would <span class="reg">admit</span>, they might in
                         every moment, but the <span class="reg">Sun</span> considering her as an enemy to <span class="reg">himself</span>,
                         <span class="reg">always</span> pursues her flying, and can never take her weary,<span class="underline"> as Buchanan <span class="note-mark">*</span>
            <div class="margin-note">
               <span class="note-mark">*</span>Buchanan?</div> in his <span class="reg">book</span> of Spheres in</span>geniously <span class="reg">has</span> declared: For imitation and  example of that great <span class="reg">Sun</span>, and shadow thereof, the Philosophers have
                         observed that their <span class="reg">Sun</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> a <span class="reg">black</span>, cloudy, and flying Shadow:
                         Hereupon <span class="reg">Says</span> Hermes, My <span class="reg">Son</span>! take from the ray its shadow, that is,
                         see that you bring your <span class="reg">Sun</span> round about the primum mobile, of  which Vulcan is made overseer, that even that part of your Earth, which
                         is now covered with a shady night, may <span class="reg">obtain</span> the clear light of the  <span class="reg">Sun</span>: for if the whole Firmament of the heaven with all things contained were not every <span class="reg">natural</span> day, that is, in twenty four <span class="reg">hours</span>
         <span class="reg">altogether</span> circumvolved by the first motion, but the <span class="reg">Sun</span>
         <span class="reg">only</span> moved by its <span class="reg">own</span> (<span class="reg">called</span> the second and <span class="reg">annual</span>) motion, it would happen that they, which
                         are Antipodes below us, would for the Space of <span class="reg">almost</span> six <span class="reg">months</span> have
                         a night, and <span class="reg">we</span> a day, and afterwards on the contrary they a day and  <span class="reg">we</span> a night; <span class="reg">so</span> that the whole year would consist of one night and  day, as now these courses are by experience and reason confirmed to be  most true under both the Poles: But it <span class="reg">seemed</span>
         <span class="reg">far</span> otherwise to divine providence, which therefore <span class="reg">has</span> ordained two motions of the Planets, the first
                         and second, and <span class="reg">so</span> distributed the year into many <span class="reg">days</span>: Now that shadow and <span class="reg">Sun</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> together make day and night, which the <span class="reg">Sun</span> by
                         <span class="reg">itself</span> alone could not effect, whose property it is to illuminate all opposite
                         places and <span class="reg">bodies</span>, but not make a shadow, except accidentally by his absence:
                         <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">Sun</span>
         <span class="reg">does</span> with its shadow make a day, that
                         is, light and night or <span class="reg">darkness</span>, namely Latona or Magnesia, whose  Shadow Democritus <span class="reg">teaches</span>, as appears in the third <span class="reg">book</span> of his <span class="pb">142</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 45.</span> Golden table at the <span class="reg">beginning</span>, must be extinguished and consumed by a fiery
                         medicine. The utility of shadows in <span class="reg">Astronomical</span> affairs is <span class="reg">so</span> great, that  without them that Science can scarce be perfected; Chymists <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> ascribe
                         it to their shadows, that their art comes to perfection; for what is this <span class="reg">Sun</span> without a shadow? As a clapper without a bell: That indeed makes the first
                         motion to a sound, but this gives the sound; that is the quill, this the instrument; that the tongue, this the great mouth: A shadow is a most contemptible
                         thing, not next to a Being, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> the Philosophers shadow is a thing  <span class="reg">black</span> blacker than <span class="reg">black</span>, as they <span class="reg">term</span> it, or of <span class="reg">less</span> esteem than weeds,  not in respect of <span class="reg">itself</span>, but the opinion of men and plenty; What more  <span class="reg">commodious</span> than fire, what more <span class="reg">precious</span> than water, what more amiable  than earth, which <span class="reg">yields</span> flowers and all amiable things, what more pleasant than <span class="reg">air</span>, which being <span class="reg">restrained</span> and obstructed, all things cease to be
                         pleasant? Yet <span class="reg">nevertheless</span>, because they are <span class="reg">exposed</span> to mens uses in their
                         large Spheres, they are esteemed most vile, by a <span class="reg">preposterous</span> imagination:  <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> is both the common and <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> shadow undervalued; They  that live long in subterranean shadows, if brought suddenly to the clear  light of the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">lose</span> their eyesight; <span class="reg">So</span> they that reside and
                         operate in the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> shadow alone, and <span class="reg">do</span> not <span class="reg">join</span> the  <span class="reg">Sun</span> with it, are deprived of <span class="reg">judgment</span> and the sight of the mind, and
                         frustrated of the effect: The <span class="reg">celestial</span>
         <span class="reg">Sun</span> being elevated upon the  South there is greater heat and <span class="reg">less</span> shadow; <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> here heat being increased the shadow is diminished, and on the contrary; <span class="reg">We</span> must therefore begin the <span class="reg">Sun</span> being from the <span class="reg">meridional</span> side bending <span class="reg">itself</span> 
         <span class="reg">again</span> to the top of our head, in <span class="reg">Capricorn</span>; and the first operation will  be even finished at Aries, then begins the womens <span class="reg">work</span>, even to Leo;  and afterwards <span class="reg">labor</span> proceeds from <span class="reg">labor</span>, till the year take the <span class="reg">tail</span> with the head, as a Snake, that is to say, is completed . . . . . . .</div>
