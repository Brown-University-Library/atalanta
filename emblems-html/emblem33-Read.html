      <div class="ab"> It is one of the secrets of Nature, that in the cold winter <span class="reg">Frogs</span> and <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> Horseleeches <span class="reg">lie</span> as it were dead under water, and in the Spring new  heat of the <span class="reg">Sun</span> operating recover sense and motion, or <span class="reg">perform</span> the actions of a <span class="reg">sensitive</span> life: But if they be found in the waters  in the winter time, and brought into the <span class="reg">air</span> or a <span class="reg">warm</span> house, they
                         presently begin to move themselves, as in the Summer: From whence
                         it appears, that they want nothing but <span class="reg">external</span> heat, to excite the
                         <span class="reg">natural</span>
         <span class="reg">internal</span> heat, and bring it to action: After the same manner <span class="reg">do</span> the Philosophers <span class="reg">speak</span> of their Hermaphrodite, who, if <span class="reg">he</span> appears dead lying in <span class="reg">darkness</span>, requires the heat of fire: Now <span class="reg">he</span> is <span class="reg">said</span> to <span class="reg">lie</span> in <span class="reg">darkness</span>, being left in a <span class="reg">dark</span> and most cold winters night, that is, remaining in <span class="reg">blackness</span>, which is a <span class="reg">sign</span> of <span class="reg">coldness</span>,
                         from which <span class="reg">he</span> ought to be brought to <span class="reg">whiteness</span> by a greater intension
                         of fire, and by yet a greater, to <span class="reg">redness</span>: For, as Bodillus in Turba <span class="reg">says</span>,
                         nothing is generated without heat, and a bath of vehement heat <span class="reg">causes</span> a body to perish, if it be cold it drives it away, but if it be temperate, it
                         becomes <span class="reg">agreeable</span> and pleasant to the body. Bonellus in the same <span class="reg">says</span>,
                         All things that live <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> (God <span class="reg">so</span> pleasing) <span class="reg">die</span>: that nature therefore, which is <span class="reg">deprived</span> of moisture, being <span class="reg">exposed</span> by night, seems like
                         a dead man, and then that nature requires fire, till the body and Spirit of it be turned into earth, and then it becomes dust like to a dead
                         man in his <span class="reg">tomb</span>: these things being accomplished God restores a Spirit
                         and <span class="reg">Soul</span> to it, and all infirmity being taken away our nature is comforted and amended: It is therefore requisite to <span class="reg">burn</span> that matter without
                         fear etc. Fire therefore, which <span class="reg">destroys</span> all other things, <span class="reg">repairs</span> this, that
                         which <span class="reg">yields</span> death to others gives life to this. One <span class="reg">only</span>
         <span class="reg">Phoenix</span> there is,
                         which is restored by fire, which is renewed by flames, and revives out of
                         ashes, and this being <span class="reg">known</span> to the Philosophers <span class="reg">only</span> is burnt and
                         restored to life, whatsoever other men <span class="reg">dream</span> of a bird, I know not  what, that <span class="reg">flies</span>, residing <span class="reg">nowhere</span>, nor seen, but as a fable. The
                         Hermaphrodite, of which the Philosophers <span class="reg">speak</span>, is of a <span class="reg">mixed</span> nature, male and female, whereof one <span class="reg">passes</span> into another by the  operation of heat, for the female is converted into a male, which  ought not to seem <span class="reg">so</span> strange in the Philosophers <span class="reg">work</span>, it being  found, if <span class="reg">we</span> may <span class="reg">believe</span>
         <span class="reg">histories</span>, that many men have <span class="reg">also</span> 
         <span class="reg">changed</span> their sex: The <span class="reg">Poets</span> make mention of Ceneus, Iphis, and
                         Tiresias, as Pontanus in the <span class="reg">Stars</span>.

         <span class="reg">So</span> in the Consulship of Licinius Crassus, and Caius Cassius Longinus

         <span class="fw">Discourse 33.</span> at Cassinum a boy was made of a Virgin: And Licinius Mutianus in Pliny relates, that <span class="reg">he</span> had seen one Aristontes at Argos, called <span class="reg">also</span> by the  name of Aristusa, who was <span class="reg">married</span>, and <span class="reg">soon</span> after discovered a beard  and virility, and <span class="reg">married</span> a wife: Pliny <span class="reg">himself</span>
         <span class="reg">says</span> that in Africa
                         <span class="reg">he</span> saw Lucius Cossicius a Citizen of Tisdritane <span class="reg">changed</span> into a woman
                         on the day of <span class="reg">marriage</span>: <span class="reg">certain</span> it is that these things are true, and  might be proved by many other examples, if need were: but the <span class="reg">genital</span> or virile parts are thrust out of the body by the <span class="reg">increase</span> of heat:
                         For a woman being much colder than a man, and having inwardly  those things absconded, which a man <span class="reg">has</span> outwardly, as <span class="reg">Physicians</span> say, hereupon Nature being dubious, whether <span class="reg">She</span> Should generate a  man or a woman, <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">expressed</span> a woman outwardly, though inwardly  <span class="reg">she</span>
         <span class="reg">conceived</span> a man: for which reason heat and motion increasing  through age the hidden parts broke forth, and <span class="reg">showed</span> themselves visibly
                         to all men: After the same manner with the Philosophers the woman is
                         <span class="reg">turned</span> into a man heat being increased, that is, the Hermaphrodite <span class="reg">looses</span> the female sex, and becomes a man stout and grave, having  nothing in him of effeminacy or levity. <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">we</span> some time since  saw a noble youth an Hermaphrodite changed or rather promoted (by
                         the industry of the <span class="reg">Surgical</span> art <span class="reg">performed</span> by that most famous
                         <span class="reg">Physician</span> Caspius Tagliacotius of Bononia) into a perfect man, fit (as
                         was desired) for the generating of an offspring, a new hole being made
                         through the yard, which was wanting there, and the lower as appertaining to the woman being <span class="reg">stopped</span> up. The Philosophers are not without
                         all these <span class="reg">manual</span> operations: for when the <span class="reg">coldness</span> and <span class="reg">moistness</span> of  Luna appears, that they call the woman, when the heat and siccity of
                         Sol, the man; <span class="add">when</span> all those four <span class="reg">qualities</span> together, <span class="del">being</span> their Rebis or Hermaphrodite; And thus conversion of the woman may easily be made,
                         that is, the mutation of <span class="reg">coldness</span> and <span class="reg">moistness</span>, into the man, which is
                         done by the sole heat of fire, as <span class="reg">has</span> been <span class="reg">said</span>; for heat sequesters,  and separates the <span class="reg">superfluities</span> of moistures, and will establish the  idea of <span class="reg">itself</span> in the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> subject, which is the tincture . .</div>
