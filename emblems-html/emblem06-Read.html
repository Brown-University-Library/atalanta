                   and <span class="reg">Physician</span> first, because their works are very conspicuous in the imitation,  emendation, and perfection of nature: <span class="milestone">e06-02</span>for they both take a <span class="reg">natural</span> subject,
                   in which they according to art add some <span class="reg">certain</span> things necessary being wanting,
                   or <span class="reg">also</span> remove those things which are superfluous: <span class="milestone">e06-03</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> that the art of both may
                   (as medicine by Hippocrates) be defined by the addition of defect, and subtracttion of superfluity: <span class="milestone">e06-04</span>for what <span class="reg">does</span> the Husbandman more than add ploughing, ridging
                   furrowing, harrowing, dunging or manuring, sowing, etc. to land left by nature, that
                   is, commit the increase and good <span class="reg">success</span> to nature, which <span class="reg">administers</span> the heat
                   of the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, and <span class="reg">rain</span>, and <span class="reg">multiplies</span> the seeds by them, and promotes them to
                   standing <span class="reg">corn</span> soon after to be reaped: <span class="milestone">e06-05</span>in the <span class="reg">mean</span> time whilst the <span class="reg">herb</span> is  Springing the husbandman weeds out thistles and all impediments, gathers  the <span class="reg">corn</span> being ripe, takes away things superfluous from it being reaped, namely
                   straw, <span class="reg">chaff</span>, and such other things: <span class="milestone">e06-06</span>
         <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> a <span class="reg">Physician</span> (as <span class="reg">also</span> a Chymist in

                   a <span class="reg">vein</span>, being wanting restores it by <span class="reg">appointing</span> good order of <span class="reg">diet</span>, evacuaates noxious humors by purgation, and <span class="reg">so</span> imitates, <span class="reg">supplies</span>, and amends
                   nature a thousand ways by the works of the understanding and art; which
                   being notorious, <span class="reg">Chymical</span> things are rather to be considered by us: <span class="milestone">e06-07</span>for Chymistry <span class="reg">does</span> first declare the operations of agriculture by its secret bounds  and <span class="reg">ways</span> of operating: <span class="milestone">e06-08</span>Husbandmen have land, wherein to sow seed, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> the Chymists: They have dung wherewith to manure their ground, <span class="reg">so</span> 
         <span class="reg">also</span> these, without which nothing could be done, nor any successe expected:
                   They have seed, the multiplication of which they desire: <span class="milestone">e06-09</span>
         <span class="underline">if Chymists</span>
