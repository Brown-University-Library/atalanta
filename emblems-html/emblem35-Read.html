                         the food and <span class="reg">pursued</span> the hare, because <span class="reg">he</span> was <span class="reg">so</span> accustomed, but
                         the other not regarding the hare, <span class="reg">emptied</span> the <span class="reg">pot</span>, <span class="reg">he</span> being <span class="reg">also</span> 
         <span class="reg">so</span> accustomed: which being done, behold, <span class="reg">says</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span>, here you see by
                         little ones, how <span class="reg">far</span> education and <span class="reg">custom</span> may <span class="reg">prevail</span>, even in those,
                         which nature <span class="reg">has</span> produced exactly alike, and of the same litter: After
                         this manner therefore is it convenient to rectify or direct nature to better things, which is as wax, easily flexible to vice or virtue. That  which <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span> demonstrated to be true in <span class="reg">politics</span>, the Philosophers
                         <span class="reg">do</span> agree to be <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> in <span class="reg">Physics</span>. How <span class="reg">effectual</span>
         <span class="reg">custom</span> is in  men and brutes daily examples are seen throughout the whole world,

                         <span class="reg">he</span> is brought to youth, to which attaining, <span class="reg">he</span> is able to provide for  <span class="reg">himself</span>: And Arnold in the Rosary booke 2. Chapt 7. Yet the Medicine
                         must be a long time roasted by fire, and nourished as a child  with the breasts. These same things have the most ancient Philosophers been pleased to demonstrate by the <span class="reg">allegories</span> of Triptolemus and Achilles accustomed to <span class="reg">lie</span> and being hardened in fire, they
                         both denoting nothing <span class="reg">else</span> but the <span class="reg">Chymical</span> subject, besides which
                         the fable would be insignificant and absurd, unworthy either to be
                         appropriated to other <span class="reg">moral</span> things, or inculcated to the ears of the  learned: Ceres did as a <span class="reg">Nurse</span> feed Triptolemus in the day time  with <span class="reg">milk</span>, and in the night <span class="reg">laid</span> him in fire, whereupon the  youth being very well nourished, his father Eleusius at length  <span class="reg">took</span> notice of it: hereupon Ceres <span class="reg">killed</span> Eleusius, and gave the  youth Triptolemus a <span class="reg">chariot</span>
         <span class="reg">drawn</span> with winged Dragons,  whereby <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">passed</span> through the <span class="reg">air</span> into all parts of the world,  and taught men how to sow <span class="reg">corn</span>: But this Triptolemus is the  tincture nourished by fire after a <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> manner, which
                         being <span class="reg">drawn</span> by Serpents, that is, Mercury, taught men how the

         <span class="fw">Discourse 35.</span> Philosophers seeds are to be cast into their earth. These same things
                         are ascribed to Osiris, who to that end <span class="reg">took</span> a view of the whole world,
                         as <span class="reg">we</span> have <span class="reg">elsewhere</span> demonstrated, and to Dionysius, who travelled  throughout the world teaching men the use of wine: Now these three
                         Triptolemus, Osiris, and Dionysius are of one intention and office,  yea one thing; as <span class="reg">also</span> Achilles, who being most valiant was to be  sent to the <span class="reg">Trojan</span>
         <span class="reg">war</span>; his father was Peleus, that is, earth, or the
                         <span class="reg">mountain</span> Peleus, his mother Thetis <span class="reg">goddess</span> of the Sea or waters; from
                         these Achilles descended: But at their <span class="reg">nuptials</span> the golden apple of Eris
                         was produced, the first cause of the <span class="reg">Trojan</span>
         <span class="reg">war</span>, wherefore <span class="reg">proceeding</span> from those <span class="reg">nuptials</span> reason there was that <span class="reg">he</span> should determine
                         it: Achilles is <span class="reg">said</span> to be hardened by his mother after the same manner  as the <span class="reg">aforesaid</span> Triptolemus by Ceres, concerning <span class="reg">whom</span>
         <span class="reg">we</span> have
                         <span class="reg">said</span> enough in the 6th <span class="reg">book</span> of <span class="reg">Hieroglyphics</span>, which here to repeat  <span class="reg">we</span>
         <span class="reg">think</span> superfluous. The nutriment therefore of the Stone is fire,
                         but it is not thereby (as some may falsely imagine) extended into longitude, latitude, and profundity, nor <span class="reg">does</span> it receive increment in  weight; because it acquires <span class="reg">only</span> virtue, maturation, and <span class="reg">color</span> from
                         fire, carrying all the rest with it as <span class="reg">viatics</span> provisions: For when its  parts are from <span class="reg">several</span> places congested, purged, and <span class="reg">conjoined</span>, it <span class="reg">has</span> in
                         it all things requisite for it: Whereupon <span class="reg">says</span> a Philosopher in the Rosary. Omnia fert Secum quibus indiget hæc aqua fœtum.
                         Nor indeed is any strange thing added to it from the beginning to the
                         end, except it be homogeneous, nor separated, if not heterogeneous:  But every man ought to consider, before <span class="reg">he</span> begin any thing, how <span class="reg">he</span> may come to the knowledge of those Dragons that are to be <span class="reg">joined</span> to
                         the chariot of Triptolemus, which are winged and volatile, which
                         if you desire to know, you will find them in the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> dung:  for they are dung, and are generated from dung, and are that <span class="reg">vessel</span>,
                         which Mary <span class="reg">says</span>, is not <span class="reg">negromantical</span>, but the regiment of your
                         fire, without which you will effect nothing: I have revealed to you  the truth, which by incredible pains I acquired from the monuments
                         of the Ancients, not without the expense of many years . . . .</div>
