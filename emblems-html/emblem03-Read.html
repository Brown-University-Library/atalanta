                   body <span class="del">is</span> brought to great clarity and perfection. <span class="milestone">e03-04</span>For all <span class="reg">Chymical</span> operations,
                   as Calcination, Sublimation, Solution, Distillation, Descension, Coagulation, Fixation, and the rest, are perfected by ablution alone: <span class="milestone">e03-05</span>For <span class="reg">he</span> that <span class="reg">washes</span> an  impure thing with water, performs the same thing, as is accomplished by <span class="reg">so</span> many forms of operating: <span class="milestone">e03-06</span>For, as the Philosophers Rosary <span class="reg">says</span> the <span class="reg">linen</span> of
                   prince Duenech being defiled by sweat, must be washed by fire, and burned  by water: <span class="milestone">e03-07</span>by which fire and water seem to have given one another <span class="reg">mutual</span>
         <span class="reg">qualities</span>, or that the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> fire is not of the same kind with <span class="reg">common</span> fire, and
                   the same must be <span class="reg">supposed</span> of the water. <span class="milestone">e03-08</span>As for Calx vive, and ignis Gr√¶cus <span class="reg">we</span> know that they are kindled by water, and <span class="reg">no</span> wise extinguished, contrary to  the nature of other things that are subject to take fire: <span class="reg">so</span> they <span class="reg">affirm</span> that
                   Camphore being kindled before burnes in water: <span class="milestone">e03-09</span>and the Stone <span class="reg">called</span> Gagates (as
                   Ansell de Bood attests) being kindled is more easily extinguished by <span class="reg">oil</span> than <span class="del">by</span> water: for <span class="reg">Oil</span> is <span class="subst">
            <span class="del">not</span>
            <span class="add">mixed</span>
         </span> with it, and suffocates the fired body:
                   <span class="milestone">e03-10</span>water not being able to mix <span class="reg">itself</span> with <span class="reg">fatness</span>, gives place to the body  being fired, <span class="reg">unless</span> it <span class="reg">altogether</span> cover and <span class="reg">overwhelm</span> it: but that cannot easily be done, because it is a stone, and swims upon the top of the  water, as all <span class="reg">oil</span>: <span class="reg">So</span> Naphta, Petroleum, and the like being kindled <span class="reg">do</span> not much fear water. <span class="milestone">e03-11</span>Some write of the Subterranean coals in the dominion
                   of Liege, that being kindled in the earth, they cannot be extinguished by
                   water, but <span class="reg">only</span> by throwing and heaping the dust of the earth upon them:
                   as Cor: <span class="milestone">e03-12</span>Tacitus declares of the like kind of fire, which cannot be quenched
                   by water, but <span class="reg">only</span> by clubs, and garments taken <span class="reg">off</span> from the body: <span class="milestone">e03-13</span>there
                   is therefore a great diversity of <span class="superscript">1</span>fires, <span class="superscript">8</span>and <span class="superscript">9</span>

         <span class="reg">does</span> sometimes <span class="reg">sustain</span> fire, as those fine Byssinian <span class="reg">clothes</span>, formerly used and
                   esteemed by rich men, which were <span class="reg">washed</span>, or reduced to former <span class="reg">cleanness</span>,
                   by fire, not by water, the <span class="reg">feces</span> being burned away: <span class="milestone">e03-15</span>Whatsoever some men
                   vainly <span class="reg">talk</span> of the <span class="reg">hairs</span> of the reptile Salamander, as if incombustible

         <span class="milestone">e03-16</span>of <span class="reg">Talc</span>, plumous Alum,
                   and such other matters, which was frequently purged by fire, but that the art  was lost and extinct with the artist (a woman of Antwerp) through envy, and that
                   the same temperament could not be found afterwards: <span class="reg">We</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> not here <span class="reg">speak</span> of

            <span class="milestone">e03-17</span>Philosophical</span> Subject must be considered according
                   to all these differences, if at any time it be <span class="reg">prepared</span>: for fire, water, and matter
                   <span class="reg">itself</span> is here not <span class="reg">common</span>: for the Philosophers fire is water, and water fire:  <span class="milestone">e03-18</span>their water <span class="reg">does</span> at once both wash and calcine, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> their fire: and the  <span class="reg">clothes</span> which are to be <span class="reg">washed</span> have the nature of the byssinean textures, or
                   <span class="reg">prepared</span>
         <span class="reg">Talc</span>, the temperament of which, and art of <span class="reg">preparation</span> is <span class="reg">also</span> not obvious to all men: <span class="milestone">e03-19</span>
         <span class="underline">To wash them, they make a Lixivium, or Lye, not  with the ashes, or Salt of Oaks,</span> bu<span class="underline">t <span class="reg">metallic</span>, which is more durable than  the other, nor with <span class="reg">common</span> water,</span>

                   standing waters of ditches or Marshes, and therefore can better penetrate into
