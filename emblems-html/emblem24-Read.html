      <div class="ab"> It is a thing <span class="reg">commonly</span>
         <span class="reg">known</span>, how great the hunger and voracity of a <span class="reg">wolf</span> is:<span class="milestone">e03-01</span>

            <span class="unclear">neither the Rx of ♁, . . . nor ♂ are so extreme hungry</span>
         </div> for when <span class="reg">he</span> wants food, <span class="underline">in extreme hunger</span>
         <span class="underline">
            <span class="reg">he</span> feeds upon the earth:</span> which
                         <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> is <span class="reg">said</span> to disgorge, if <span class="reg">he</span> come amongst great heards of beasts, that
                         being made more heavy with that <span class="reg">pack</span> as it were, <span class="reg">he</span> cannot be <span class="reg">so</span> easily
                         <span class="reg">Shaked</span> off, but resists more strongly and furiously. Having <span class="reg">entered</span> into the
                         folds, <span class="reg">he</span> not <span class="reg">only</span> kills what is sufficient for his belly, but <span class="reg">also</span> through
                         <span class="reg">greediness</span>
         <span class="reg">destroys</span> the whole <span class="reg">flock</span> on every side. <span class="reg">He</span> is consecrated to
                         Apollo and Latona, because <span class="reg">he</span> stood by her when <span class="reg">she</span> was in <span class="reg">labor</span>: for
                         neither could Latona have been delivered without the <span class="reg">presence</span> of the
                         <span class="reg">wolf</span>: and therefore the <span class="reg">wolf</span> is not without reason reported to be acceptable to Apollo, whose birthday <span class="reg">he</span> celebrated; as <span class="reg">also</span> because <span class="underline">his eyes</span> 
         <span class="underline">
            <span class="reg">do</span> shine and cast forth light by night.</span> Th<span class="underline">e <span class="reg">breathless</span> body of the</span> 
         <span class="underline">King is cast to him be</span>ing e<span class="underline">xtreme hungry</span>, not to the end that <span class="reg">he</span> should
                         <span class="reg">wholly</span> consume and annihilate it, but to restore life and strength to it
                         by his <span class="reg">own</span> death: For there is I know not what <span class="underline">amatory virtue</span> in the  <span class="underline">
            <span class="reg">wolves'</span>
            <span class="reg">tail</span>
         </span>, whi<span class="underline">ch is infused</span>
         <span class="underline">into the King being <span class="reg">half</span> dead,</span> which makes
                         him very <span class="reg">desirable</span> to all men, <span class="reg">he</span> restoring pristine health and beauty:  The Hyrcanians brought up <span class="reg">dogs</span> for <span class="reg">no</span> other use, than to <span class="reg">devour</span> the
                         <span class="reg">bodies</span> of dead men cast to them, as Cicero relates: <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> the Massagetæ <span class="reg">do</span> give men that <span class="reg">die</span> of diseases as prey to <span class="reg">dogs</span>: But the Philosophers ex<span class="underline">pose their King to a <span class="reg">wolf</span>
         </span> nor indeed did the <span class="reg">custom</span> of the
                         <span class="reg">Sabeans</span> please them, in carrying out the <span class="reg">corpses</span> of the deceased after the
                         same manner as dung, who <span class="reg">also</span> threw their Kings amongst dung hills,  nor of the Troglodytes, who <span class="reg">tied</span> the <span class="reg">neck</span> of a dead man to their feet,  and <span class="reg">hurried</span> him along with jests and laughter, and without any consideration of the place <span class="reg">buried</span> him: But they had rather herein follow the
                         <span class="reg">custom</span> of the Magi, <span class="underline">who</span>
         <span class="underline">did not bury their <span class="reg">bodies</span>
         </span>, be<span class="underline">fore they were</span> 
         <span class="underline">
            <span class="reg">torn</span> to <span class="reg">pieces</span> by wild beasts:</span> Or of the Indians, who caused themselves
                         to be <span class="reg">buried</span> alive, with Crowns on Singing, the <span class="reg">praises</span> of the Gods, lest old
                         age should <span class="reg">prevent</span>. but this <span class="reg">custom</span> was fatally <span class="reg">imposed</span> upon them all without
                         any hope of resurrection, or renovation of life: the Philosophers determine  <span class="reg">far</span> otherwise: for they have most <span class="reg">certain</span> knowledge, <span class="underline">that their dead King</span> 
         <span class="underline">devoured by the <span class="reg">wolf</span> will appear with life, strength, and youth, and the</span> 
         <span class="underline">
            <span class="reg">wolf</span> must be burned in his stead:</span> For the <span class="reg">wolf</span> may easily be put to death,
                         if <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> gorged his belly, <span class="underline">but the King, though dead, <span class="reg">has</span> notwit</span>h<span class="underline">standing a <span class="reg">Martial</span> or Swanlike virtue <span class="reg">so</span> as not to be wounded nor con</span>
         <span class="underline">sumed: B</span>ut <span class="underline">where must this <span class="reg">wolf</span> be sought fo</span>r, and <span class="underline">from whence must</span> 
         <span class="underline">the King be had?</span> The Philosophers answer, t<span class="underline">hat the <span class="reg">wolf</span> wanders every</span> 
         <span class="underline">where in mountains and <span class="reg">valleys</span>, to take his prey,</span> who must be <span class="reg">drawn</span> out
                         <span class="underline">of his harbou</span>rs, a<span class="underline">nd<span class="reg">preserved</span> for use:</span>
         <span class="underline">The King <span class="reg">also</span> coming from the</span>

            <span class="reg">wolf</span>

                         those that are bred in a cold climate are more fierce, than in Africa or <span class="reg">Egypt</span>,
                         by reason of greater hunger <span class="underline">

                         and be discovered, they are by their <span class="reg">adversaries</span> taken for <span class="reg">Spies</span> and imprisoned; if <span class="reg">also</span> being detected they proceed without an army they are  after the same manner in danger: <span class="reg">so</span>
