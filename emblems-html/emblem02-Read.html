         <span class="milestone">e02-01</span>It is concluded by the <span class="reg">Peripatetics</span>, and Orthodox Philosophers, that the  thing nourishing is converted into the substance of the thing nourished, and  assimilated to it, not indeed before, but after the alteration of it, and that is accounted an infallible <span class="reg">axiom</span>: <span class="milestone">e02-02</span>for how would the thing nourishing (which is allready before the like and the same with the thing nourished) have need of
                         the mutation of its essence, which if it should happen, it would not <span class="reg">remain</span> the same nor the like; or how should those things, which cannot be assimilated
                         to the thing nourished, be taken for nutriment, <span class="milestone">e02-03</span>such as are wood, stones and  the like? <span class="milestone">e02-04</span>as therefore the first is <span class="reg">vain</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> the other is contrary to nature; <span class="milestone">e02-05</span>but
                         for an Infant new <span class="reg">born</span> to be nourished by the <span class="reg">milk</span> of <span class="reg">animals</span>, is a thing
                         not repugnant to nature: because assimilation of it may be made, but far
                         more easily of the mothers, than of anothers: <span class="milestone">e02-06</span>wherefore <span class="reg">Physicians</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> conclude, that it <span class="reg">conduces</span> to the health, similitude of substance and manners,
                         as <span class="reg">also</span> strength of an Infant, if it be <span class="reg">always</span> nourished by the <span class="reg">milk</span> of its  <span class="reg">own</span> mother, on the contrary if by anothers. <span class="milestone">e02-07</span>This is the harmony of every 
                         nature, that like delights in its like, and <span class="reg">follows</span> its footsteps, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">far</span> as it
                         is able, in all things, with a <span class="reg">certain</span> tacit consent and conspiration: <span class="milestone">e02-08</span>the same
                         thing usually happens in the <span class="reg">natural</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span> of the Philosophers, which is <span class="reg">equally</span> governed by nature in the conformation of it, as an infant in the mothers  <span class="reg">womb</span>; <span class="milestone">e02-09</span>and though a father and mother, and <span class="reg">nurse</span>
         <span class="del">itself</span> be by way of similitude ascribed to it, yet it is not more <span class="reg">artificial</span>, than the generation of
                         every <span class="reg">animal</span>: <span class="milestone">e02-10</span>two seeds are by a <span class="reg">certain</span> pleasant artifice <span class="reg">joined</span> together
                         by <span class="reg">animals</span>, and both <span class="reg">human</span> sexes, which being united <span class="reg">do</span> by successive
                         alteration produce an Embryo, which <span class="reg">grows</span> and is increased, acquires life  and motion, and then is nourished by <span class="reg">milk</span>: <span class="milestone">e02-11</span>but necessary it is for the woman in time of conception and <span class="reg">impregnation</span> to carry <span class="reg">herself</span> temperately
                         in heat, meat and <span class="reg">drink</span>, motion and rest, and other circumstances, otherwise
                         an abortion will follow, and destruction of the conceived Embryo, which  observation in six things not <span class="reg">natural</span>, because it is <span class="reg">prescribed</span> by <span class="reg">Physicians</span> according to their art, is <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">artificial</span>. <span class="milestone">e02-12</span>After the same manner if the  seeds be not joyned together in the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span>, they ought to be
                         <span class="reg">joined</span>: but if they could be found somewhere <span class="reg">joined</span> together, as the seed
                         of the <span class="reg">Cock</span> and <span class="reg">Hen</span> are had in an <span class="reg">egg</span> subsisting together in one  continent, then would the Philosophers <span class="reg">work</span> be yet more <span class="reg">natural</span>, than
                         the generation of <span class="reg">animals</span>. <span class="milestone">e02-13</span>But let us grant, as the Philosophers <span class="reg">do</span> assert,
                         that one comes from the east and another from the west, and are made one,
                         what more is <span class="reg">administered</span> to them, than mixti<span class="subst">

         <span class="reg">vessel</span>, temperate heat and nutriment? <span class="milestone">e02-14</span>the <span class="reg">vessel</span> is indeed <span class="reg">artificial</span>, but herein is
                         <span class="reg">no</span> difference, whether the nest be made by the <span class="reg">Hen</span>

                         is a <span class="reg">natural</span> thing, whether it proceed from the temperate fire of furnaces, and putrefaction of dung, or from the <span class="reg">Sun</span> and <span class="reg">air</span>, or <span class="reg">bowels</span> of the mother, or <span class="reg">elsewhere</span>: thus the <span class="reg">Egyptian</span> doth by art administer <span class="pb">13</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 2.</span> 
         <span class="reg">natural</span> heat by his furnaces for the hatching of eggs: <span class="milestone">e02-16</span>the Seeds of <span class="reg">silk</span>worms, yea even <span class="reg">hen</span> eggs are <span class="reg">said</span> to be hatched by the warmth of a Virgins
                         breasts: <span class="milestone">e02-17</span>Art therefore and Nature <span class="reg">do</span> mutually <span class="reg">help</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> as to officiate one for the  other: <span class="reg">nevertheless</span> nature is <span class="reg">always</span> the <span class="reg">Mistress</span>, and Art the servant. <span class="milestone">e02-18</span>But to say
                         the earth is the <span class="reg">Nurse</span> of the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> babe, might create an objection to any
                         one, the earth being of all the elements most dry and <span class="reg">void</span> of juice, to which siccity
                         as the proper quality appertains: <span class="milestone">e02-19</span>but it may be <span class="reg">answered</span>, th<span class="underline">at the earth elemented</span> is here understood, not the Element, which <span class="reg">we</span>
         <span class="reg">took</span> notice enough of in the first
                         day of the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">week</span>, and explained nature: <span class="milestone">e02-20</span>This (earth) is the <span class="reg">nurse</span> of CÃ¦lum, not in opening, washing or watering the babe, but coagulating, fixing and colouring, and converting it into mere juice and blood: <span class="milestone">e02-21</span>For nutrition <span class="reg">implies</span> augmentation in length, breadth, and depth, that is, extending  <span class="reg">itself</span> through all dimensions of the body, which being here, and <span class="reg">performed</span> by earth alone to the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> babe, the name of <span class="reg">nurse</span> is not  without reason to be <span class="reg">ascribed</span> to earth: <span class="milestone">e02-22</span>but a thing contrary to the other  kinds of <span class="reg">milk</span>, which are converted and <span class="reg">do</span> not convert, happens in this
