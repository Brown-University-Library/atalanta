         <span class="milestone">e05-01</span>The whole troop of <span class="del">the</span> Philosophers <span class="reg">do</span> herein consent, that their <span class="reg">work</span> is  nothing <span class="reg">else</span>, but man and wife: the mans part is indeed to generate, and <span class="reg">govern</span> the wife, hers to conceive, be <span class="reg">impregnated</span>, bring forth, give <span class="reg">suck</span>, and educate
                         the offspring, and be subject to the mans <span class="reg">command</span>: <span class="milestone">e05-02</span>for as <span class="reg">She</span>
         <span class="reg">sustains</span> and  <span class="reg">nourishes</span> the conceived Embryo, before it be brought to light, with blood, <span class="reg">so</span> being brought forth with <span class="reg">milk</span>. <span class="milestone">e05-03</span>To this end Nature <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">prepared</span> for the  tender infant a digestible and proportioned food in the mothers breasts, which  waits his coming, as the first provision and viaticum in this race of the world:
                         <span class="milestone">e05-04</span>by <span class="reg">milk</span> therefore <span class="reg">he</span> is nourished, <span class="reg">grows</span>, and is increased, till <span class="reg">he</span> be furnished
                         with instruments to chaw bread, that is, teeth, then is <span class="reg">he</span> deservedly weaned, because nature <span class="reg">has</span> provided him other nutriment more solid: <span class="milestone">e05-05</span>But here the Philosophers say, that a Toad must be put to the womans breasts, that <span class="reg">She</span> may  nourish it, as an infant, with her <span class="reg">milk</span>: <span class="milestone">e05-06</span>This is a miserable and horrible spectacle,
                         yea and a wicked thing, that <span class="reg">milk</span> designed for an infant Should be given to a
                         Toad, being a venomous beast, and contrary to the nature of man: <span class="milestone">e05-07</span>
         <span class="reg">We</span> have
                         heard and read of Serpents and Dragons sucking the teats of <span class="reg">Cows</span>: Toads might
                         perhaps desire the same thing, if occasion Should be offered in beasts. <span class="milestone">e05-08</span>There is a  noted story of a Toad, who seated <span class="reg">himself</span> upon the mouth, and inside of the  <span class="reg">lips</span> of a <span class="reg">certain</span> countryman being asleep, <span class="reg">so</span> that <span class="reg">he</span> could not be driven <span class="reg">off</span> by any contrivance, <span class="reg">unless</span> by violence, which being <span class="reg">accompanied</span> with danger of
                         death, by the spitting of <span class="reg">poison</span> (which <span class="reg">he</span> is <span class="reg">said</span> to use for defensive or offensive
                         weapons) was therefore not to be attempted; <span class="milestone">e05-09</span>but a remedy being found for the  miserable man by antipathy, namely, of a very great Spider and the Toad,
                         who hate one another mortally, <span class="milestone">e05-10</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> was therefore <span class="reg">carried</span> with the Toad directly to the place, where an over<span class="subst">
            <span class="del">come</span>
            <span class="add">
               <span class="reg">grown</span>
            </span>
         </span> Spider had made its webs, which  <span class="reg">seeing</span> the Toad, <span class="reg">presently</span> came <span class="reg">down</span> upon the <span class="reg">back</span> of the Toad, and
                         <span class="reg">pricked</span> him with its sting: <span class="milestone">e05-11</span>but <span class="reg">he</span> having received <span class="reg">no</span>
         <span class="reg">harm</span> thereby, it
                         descended a second time, and <span class="reg">struck</span> him <span class="reg">again</span> more strongly, whereupon the Toad began <span class="reg">immediately</span> to swell, and fell <span class="reg">down</span> dead from the
                         mans mouth, without any hurt to him. <span class="milestone">e05-12</span>But here a thing contrary happens, because the Toad <span class="reg">seizes</span> not the mouth but the breast of the woman, by whose <span class="reg">milk</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> 
         <span class="reg">increases</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> as to be of great magnitude and strength, <span class="milestone">e05-13</span>but the woman consumes  and <span class="reg">dies</span> her spirits being taken away: for <span class="reg">poison</span> is easily <span class="reg">communicated</span> by the <span class="reg">pectoral</span> veins to the heart, and corrupts and <span class="reg">destroys</span> it, as it is evident in the case of
                         Cleopatra, who <span class="reg">applied</span> Vipers to her breasts, being willing to be <span class="reg">prevented</span> by vo<span class="note-mark">*</span>
         <div class="margin-note">
            <span class="note-mark">*</span>Theophilus in Turba makes mention of a Dragon <span class="reg">joined</span> to a woman.-</div>luntary death from being led alive into the hands and triumphs of the <span class="reg">conquerors</span>: <span class="milestone">e05-14</span>But lest any man should <span class="reg">think</span> the Philosophers <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">cruel</span>, as to <span class="reg">enjoin</span> a venomous reptile to be put to a woman, <span class="reg">he</span> must know that this Toad
                         is the offspring or <span class="reg">Son</span> of the same woman, produced by a monstrous birth,
                         and therefore by <span class="reg">natural</span> right ought to be fed and nourished by the mothers
                         <span class="reg">milk</span>, but it is not in the will of the <span class="reg">Son</span> that the mother should <span class="reg">die</span>: <span class="milestone">e05-15</span>for
                         neither could <span class="reg">he</span> infect his mother, who was coagulated in her <span class="reg">bowels</span>, and   increased by blood even to birth. <span class="milestone">e05-16</span>It is indeed a thing ominous for a Toad
                         to be <span class="reg">born</span> of a woman, which in our knowledge <span class="reg">has</span> happened <span class="reg">elsewhere</span>:

         <span class="fw">Discourse 5.</span> Guilielmus Novobrigensis, an English writer, in his <span class="reg">commentaries</span>
         <span class="reg">says</span> (how  <span class="reg">truly</span> let others judge) that in a <span class="reg">certain</span> Stonequarry in the Diocesse of the  Bishop of Winchester, a great stone being divided, there was within found a living
                         Toad with a golden <span class="reg">chain</span>, and it was by the Bishops <span class="reg">command</span> hidden in the  same place, and <span class="reg">buried</span> in <span class="reg">perpetual</span>
         <span class="reg">darkness</span>, lest it might bear an ill omen  with it: <span class="milestone">e05-17</span>Such is <span class="reg">also</span> this Toad: for it is <span class="reg">appareled</span> with gold, though not <span class="reg">extrinsically</span>, with the <span class="reg">artificial</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span> of a <span class="reg">chain</span>, yet <span class="reg">intrinsically</span> with a <span class="reg">natural</span>,
                         namely of a Stone, which some call Borax, Chelonitis, Batrachites, Crapaudina,
                         or Garatronium: <span class="milestone">e05-18</span>for this <span class="reg">far</span>

         <span class="reg">set</span> in gold, as a case or cover, that it may  not be hurt or lost. <span class="milestone">e05-19</span>But it ought to be legitimate <span class="add">being</span> had out of <span class="subst">

                         it be <span class="reg">picked</span> out of subterranean trenches, as <span class="reg">commonly</span> it is, the Stone taken up  may be made neat in the <span class="reg">form</span> of it, and used instead thereof with the best
                         <span class="reg">minerals</span>, <span class="reg">relieving</span> and comforting the heart: <span class="milestone">e05-20</span>for <span class="add">here</span> in <span class="del">these</span>
