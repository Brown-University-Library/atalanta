      <div class="ab"> The Philosophers call their Stone vegetable, because it vegetates, <span class="reg">grows</span>, <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> is <span class="reg">increased</span> and <span class="reg">multiplied</span> as a plant: which indeed to the ignorant seems
                         strange and contrary to truth; it being manifest that stones <span class="reg">do</span> neither
                         vegetate, nor grow after this manner, nor any thing at all relate to  liquable <span class="reg">metals</span>: but they are deceived in their judgment: for that which
                         is <span class="reg">unknown</span> to them they suppose is not in rerum natura, measuring
                         the immensity of the universe by their capacity: For who could ever
                         have <span class="reg">believed</span> that a stone should grow under water, or a plant there generated become a stone, if experience together with the credible <span class="reg">testimonies</span> of writers had not <span class="reg">confirmed</span> it? where is that <span class="reg">petrifying</span>, where  that tinging virtue, which <span class="reg">hardens</span> and <span class="reg">tinges</span>
         <span class="reg">Coral</span>, whether in the
                         water, or in the <span class="reg">air</span>, or in the earth? <span class="reg">we</span> may reasonably <span class="reg">believe</span> it
                         to be, as they <span class="reg">affirm</span>, a soft and <span class="underline">flexible</span> plant, whilst it is under water, yet of a very <span class="reg">terrestrial</span> nature, which, when it is cut <span class="reg">off</span> and exposed
                         to the cold winds, becomes hard, and acquires a stony frangibility, the
                         <span class="reg">watery</span> parts abounding being <span class="reg">dried</span> up by the cold and dry <span class="reg">air</span> (for these
                         North winds blowing <span class="reg">do</span> introduce siccity) and the <span class="reg">terrestrial</span> body  remaining congealed with cold and siccity <span class="reg">being</span> the <span class="reg">qualities</span> of the earth:
                         for constriction <span class="reg">appertains</span> to the earth alone, not to the water, nor <span class="reg">air</span>,
                         as to the proper and genuine virtues of either. Besides the sea in other
                         places <span class="reg">yields</span> three <span class="reg">medicinal</span> stones deduced partly from the vegetable
                         kind, partly from the <span class="reg">animal</span>, or rather partly from the secrets of nature; as Pearls, <span class="reg">Amber</span>, and <span class="reg">Ambergris</span>: the production of Pearls,  and the way of taking them have been <span class="reg">known</span> to us, but not of the
                         rest: <span class="reg">Amber</span> is found and gathered on the Sea coasts of Sudavia, on the
                         <span class="reg">shores</span>, after a most vehement South or westerly wind, which without
                         doubt <span class="reg">boils</span> out of the veins of the earth into the Sea, or is <span class="reg">washed</span> out by the water, and driven by the waves to the <span class="reg">shores</span>: For <span class="reg">we</span> have seen some veins of iron and Silver swimming with the <span class="reg">Amber</span>,
                         which could not be done but in the earth. But as to <span class="add">the</span>
         <span class="reg">flies</span>, <span class="reg">gnats</span>, Spiders, <span class="reg">Butterflies</span>, <span class="reg">frogs</span>, Serpents which are seen in some <span class="reg">pieces</span> (as
                         <span class="reg">we</span> have had 120 beads turned out of <span class="reg">Amber</span>, which did every one
                         <span class="reg">contain</span> some <span class="reg">flies</span>, <span class="reg">gnats</span>, Spiders, <span class="reg">butterflies</span>, and one particle nine,
                         not without a singular miracle of nature) that happens by the influence and imagination of the heaven; as <span class="reg">we</span> have <span class="reg">elsewhere</span> demonstrated. That <span class="reg">Ambergris</span> is found after the same manner on the
                         <span class="reg">Shores</span> of the east and west <span class="reg">Indies</span>, cannot be <span class="reg">denied</span>, and though  some declare it to be the juice or <span class="reg">gum</span> of trees, as the <span class="reg">Amber</span> 
         <span class="reg">aforesaid</span>, yet they that conceive it to proceed out of veins of the  earth <span class="reg">do</span> judge more probably: For <span class="reg">fruitful</span> trees of <span class="reg">Amber</span> have
                         been in <span class="reg">no</span> place seen, which notwithstanding, if there be, <span class="reg">do</span> most certainly grow out of the water in the open <span class="reg">air</span>: <span class="reg">We</span>
         <span class="pb">103</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 32.</span> therefore ascribe both sorts of <span class="reg">Amber</span> to subterranean veins or stones, as
                         Pearls to Zoophytes (that is, a <span class="reg">middle</span> nature between <span class="reg">animal</span> and plant)  and <span class="reg">Coral</span> to vegetables. The Philosophers stone is indeed like to these stones
                         and especially to <span class="reg">Coral</span>: for as <span class="reg">Coral</span>
         <span class="reg">grows</span> in water, and <span class="reg">draws</span> nutriment
                         from the earth; <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> stone growes in <span class="reg">Mercurial</span> water, and from it receives whatsoever is earthy, for the augmentation of <span class="reg">itself</span>, the superfluous moisture expiring. A red <span class="reg">color</span> is <span class="reg">also</span> fixed in <span class="reg">Coral</span> by coagulation, which modern authors call the tincture of <span class="reg">Corals</span>, <span class="reg">no</span> otherwise than as in the <span class="reg">Physical</span> stone, which becomes red in the last coagulation of it, and appears like the reddest <span class="reg">Coral</span>, which is the tincture:  but as <span class="reg">Coral</span> becomes hard by cold and siccity, <span class="reg">so</span> that by heat and siccity, which being augmented it likewise dissolves, contrary to the nature of
                         other stones, which <span class="reg">do</span> indeed dissolve, but <span class="reg">turn</span> into <span class="reg">glass</span>, which thing
                         is <span class="reg">nowise</span>
         <span class="reg">agreeable</span> to this: And as <span class="reg">Coral</span> is <span class="reg">prepared</span> into <span class="reg">several</span> medicines of great virtue, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span> the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">Coral</span>
         <span class="reg">transferred</span> the virtues of all herbs into <span class="reg">itself</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> that is alone is able to <span class="reg">perform</span> as much as all the medicines of all vegetables: For the <span class="reg">celestial</span>
         <span class="reg">Sun</span>,
                         which <span class="reg">infuses</span>
         <span class="reg">medicinal</span> virtue and efficacy into vegetables, contributes
                         to this its <span class="reg">Son</span> and <span class="reg">terrestrial</span> deputy more, than to all others: This is  the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> vegetable, <span class="reg">animal</span>, and <span class="reg">mineral</span>
         <span class="reg">Coral</span>, which <span class="reg">lies</span> occult in the vast ocean, and is not <span class="reg">known</span>, except it be exposed to the
                         eyes and put into the hands of the ignorant: But it must be cut <span class="reg">off</span> in
                         the water with very great caution, lest it <span class="reg">lose</span> its juice and blood, and
                         nothing <span class="reg">remain</span> but a <span class="reg">terrestrial</span> chaos without its true <span class="reg">form</span>: For
                         herein consists all the difficulty of taking <span class="reg">coral</span>, besides which there is  scarce any: The superfluous moisture. I <span class="reg">mean</span>, which kills the stone,
                         <span class="reg">unless</span> it be separated, which suffers not the <span class="reg">coraline</span>
         <span class="reg">redness</span> to  appear, which <span class="reg">admits</span> not coagulation, whilst it is therein . . . . .<span class="add"> Avoid all disputes as much as poss
