      <div class="ab"> The Philosophers have in many places made mention of two stones given to us<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> gratis, as <span class="reg">Isaac</span>, Arnold, and others, amongst <span class="reg">whom</span> Avicenne <span class="reg">says</span> they <span class="reg">lie</span> in  dung neglected and rejected by the vulgar, which, if they be <span class="reg">joined</span> together, are
                         able to complete the Magistery: Some men <span class="reg">extol</span> the <span class="reg">occidental</span> Mercury, which
                         <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">preferred</span>
         <span class="reg">itself</span> before gold, and overcome it: But the Author of the advice of the <span class="reg">wedlock</span> of Sol and Luna out of the epistle of Aristotle <span class="reg">does</span> best of all describe the two stones, where <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">says</span>: That there are two  <span class="reg">principal</span> stones of this art, the white and the red of <span class="reg">wonderful</span> nature: at
                         the setting of the <span class="reg">Sun</span> the white begins to appear upon the surface of the
                         waters, hiding <span class="reg">itself</span> till midnight, and afterwards declines to the <span class="reg">bottom</span>: But
                         the red operates contrariwise, it beginning to ascend upon the waters at the
                         rising of the <span class="reg">Sun</span> till <span class="reg">noon</span>, and then descends to the <span class="reg">bottom</span>. These  Stones therefore are the <span class="reg">aforesaid</span> Eagles sent by Jupiter from Delphi;  These <span class="reg">also</span> are the <span class="reg">wolf</span> and <span class="reg">dog</span> coming from different or opposite parts  of the earth, which <span class="reg">bit</span> and <span class="reg">werried</span> one the other, and both became mad, as  Rhasis in his epistle declares: These stones are the most true Bezoar,  whereof the east <span class="reg">Indies</span> send the best, <span class="reg">drawn</span> from the <span class="reg">bowels</span> of  wild beasts, the West <span class="reg">Indies</span>
         <span class="reg">yield</span> another but of <span class="reg">less</span> efficacy, had
                         at Peruana out of <span class="reg">animals</span> made tame; <span class="reg">So</span> the East <span class="reg">affords</span> a  most fierce <span class="reg">wolf</span>, the west a <span class="reg">dog</span> familiar to men, that is, Sulphur
                         comes from the East, Mercury from the Western tract, whereof this is
                         gentle and tractable, that <span class="reg">choleric</span> and angry; which two, when
                         first they find one another, <span class="reg">do</span> fall together by the ears: and  the <span class="reg">dog</span> being of notable <span class="reg">bigness</span> obtains the first victory,  prostrating the <span class="reg">wolf</span>, and bringing him to deaths <span class="reg">door</span>: But the
                         <span class="reg">wolf</span> recovering strength afterwards <span class="reg">overthrows</span> the <span class="reg">dog</span>, and being cast <span class="reg">down</span> never leaves him till <span class="reg">he</span> be utterly <span class="reg">killed</span> and dead;  In the <span class="reg">mean</span> time receiving from the <span class="reg">dog</span>
         <span class="reg">no</span>
         <span class="reg">less</span> wounds nor <span class="reg">less</span> 
         <span class="reg">mortal</span>, than <span class="reg">he</span> gave him, till they werry one another to death: As  touching the <span class="reg">wolf</span>
         <span class="reg">Says</span> Rosinus to Euthicia: That <span class="reg">he</span> is a <span class="reg">fortified</span> 
         <span class="reg">soldier</span> the <span class="reg">conqueror</span> of two, of much <span class="reg">esteem</span> and most intense
                         strength, perforating <span class="reg">bodies</span> when <span class="reg">he</span> meets with them, and is white
                         in apparition, red by experiment, and is the man which <span class="reg">took</span> Luna
                         to wife, <span class="reg">whom</span> some men suppose to be gold of a most <span class="reg">precious</span>
         <span class="reg">connection</span> and composition, whose congealed part is never dissolved, nor
                         footsteps or impressions defaced, which God <span class="reg">has</span> freely bestowed  upon the pious and elect Philosophers: You must know, that nature  <span class="reg">has</span> gotten an <span class="reg">equal</span> as an enemy. These are his words. And a little after
                         <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">says</span>: That Sulphur is most strong, and fighting against fire  which it <span class="reg">contains</span> and is contained: for a most <span class="reg">precious</span>
         <span class="reg">color</span> proceeds
                         from them being <span class="reg">joined</span> together, and that Sulphur, which is naturally
                         volatile, can never afterwards <span class="reg">fly</span> away, because the <span class="reg">Soul</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="pb">148</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 47.</span> perforated it, in like manner the tincture of the <span class="reg">Soul</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span> both perforated
                         and is mixed with the body, and the body <span class="reg">has</span> contained the <span class="reg">soul</span>, and
                         restrained the <span class="reg">natural</span> part from flying. And then to one demanding which
                         of the stones was strongest, <span class="reg">he</span> answers: That stone which is <span class="reg">no</span> stone
                         is stronger than the other enemy: but the red is stronger than that  which strengthened its companions by its fortitude. The <span class="reg">Oriental</span>
         <span class="reg">wolf</span> is
                         therefore stronger than the <span class="reg">Occidental</span>
         <span class="reg">dog</span>, though <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">obtain</span> not the
                         victory effectually, but <span class="reg">perishes</span> together with the enemy: but the tinging
                         <span class="reg">poison</span> is <span class="reg">produced</span> from both: The difference between a <span class="reg">wolf</span> and <span class="reg">dog</span> is
                         small, a <span class="reg">Mastiff</span> or great <span class="reg">dog</span> representing the <span class="reg">form</span> and shape of a
                         <span class="reg">wolf</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> as to <span class="reg">seem</span> a <span class="reg">wolf</span> originally, but made tame by long progeneration: After the same manner Sulphur and Mercury <span class="reg">do</span> little differ one
                         from the other, because that proceeds from this, or this from that: Mercury
                         did indeed <span class="reg">beget</span> Sulphur, but Sulphur purged Mercury and made it <span class="reg">so</span>:
                         Concerning these the same Rosinus, the <span class="reg">question</span> being asked, from  whence comes its <span class="reg">color</span>? answers, from the most intense <span class="reg">bitterness</span> of it:
                         and <span class="reg">again</span>. From whence comes its <span class="reg">bitterness</span> and intension? <span class="reg">he</span> answers
                         from the impurity of its <span class="reg">metal</span>: And <span class="reg">again</span>: Is its red <span class="reg">color</span> never supereminent? <span class="reg">he</span> answers, Yes: And <span class="reg">again</span>: Is it <span class="reg">also</span> never hotter than  fire? <span class="reg">he</span> answers; Fire in respect of it is as water in respect of fire: And
                         <span class="reg">again</span>: Is it not stronger than fire? <span class="reg">he</span> answers, not. And <span class="reg">again</span>: Why  therefore <span class="reg">do</span> you <span class="reg">affirm</span> it to be stronger than fire? <span class="reg">he</span> answers, because
                         fires meeting together <span class="reg">do</span> one destroy the other. It is therefore manifest  that one becomes the food and aliment of the other, and <span class="reg">so</span> much as one
                         <span class="reg">decreases</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> much the other <span class="reg">increases</span>, till that which <span class="reg">increases</span>
         <span class="reg">prevails</span>, and the Dragon <span class="reg">devours</span> the serpent: In great fights it often times
                         happens, that they that <span class="reg">undergo</span> the greater slaughter <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">win</span> the
                         <span class="reg">field</span> and victory; <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> though the <span class="reg">dog</span> lay prostrate, yet was not  <span class="reg">altogether</span> overcome, <span class="reg">he</span> holding his enemy <span class="reg">so</span> fast, that <span class="reg">he</span> could not
                         live without him, nor <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">die</span> without the other . . . . . . .</div>
