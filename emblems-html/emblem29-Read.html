      <div class="ab"> Two Elements there are, in which <span class="reg">animals</span> live, water and <span class="reg">air</span>, and as ma<span class="milestone">e03-01</span>ny in which <span class="reg">no</span> animated thing can live, earth and fire: For as those are
                         of a <span class="reg">middle</span> and temperate complexion in the first and second <span class="reg">qualities</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> these are extreme; <span class="reg">bodies</span> either too <span class="reg">thick</span> or too <span class="reg">subtle</span>, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">thick</span> as not
                         to <span class="reg">admit</span> other <span class="reg">bodies</span>, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">subtle</span> as indeed to admit, but to penetrate and <span class="reg">burn</span> them: But the reason why men <span class="reg">do</span> live in vaults and subterranean <span class="reg">Mines</span> is
                         because of the <span class="reg">air</span> descending thitherto, and supplying the vacuity of those
                         places: But here <span class="reg">we</span>
         <span class="reg">speak</span> of every Element apart: In water fish <span class="reg">do</span> live
                         in incredible number, variety, and fertility, yea the greatest of all <span class="reg">animals</span>; In the <span class="reg">air</span> men, fourfooted beasts, birds, <span class="reg">worms</span>, and insects: Whatsoever is <span class="reg">said</span> of Spirits <span class="reg">wandering</span> in the secret parts of the earth, is another thing, for neither are they <span class="reg">animals</span>: But they say the Salamander
                         alone lives in fire: Now the Salamander is a creeping <span class="reg">vermin</span>, not much  unlike to a Lizard, but of Slower pace, bigger head, and different <span class="reg">color</span>, such
                         as I remember I have seen in the Alps, or <span class="reg">neck</span> of Spluga, coming out of
                         the caverns of rocks after thunder and <span class="reg">rain</span>, and staying in the way, a  countryman of that place advertising that it was, called ein Molch: And it
                         had about a clammy and viscous <span class="reg">moistness</span>, by the virtue of which it
                         <span class="reg">passes</span> freely through fire without <span class="reg">harm</span>: But the Philosophers Salamander is much different, though it be assimilated to this: For that is  bred in fire, this not; but if it falls into fire it is not presently burned  by reason of its <span class="reg">exceeding</span>
         <span class="reg">coldness</span> and <span class="reg">moistness</span>, but can freely <span class="reg">pass</span> through the flame: That is <span class="reg">hot</span> and dry this cold and moist: For every
                         thing participates of the nature of the mothers <span class="reg">womb</span>, or resembles  the place and <span class="reg">country</span>: Fire <span class="reg">produces</span> nothing but that which is <span class="reg">hot</span> and dry, as its like, and on the contrary the moist and cold caverns
                         of rocks, being full of water, <span class="reg">do</span> bring forth this cold and moist <span class="reg">vermin</span>. That <span class="reg">does</span> by the similitude of nature <span class="reg">rejoice</span> in fire, this by
                         contrariety <span class="reg">extinguishes</span> it, or repells its force for some time from it.
                         They say that the <span class="reg">fly</span> called Pyrausta is generated in fire, and <span class="reg">flies</span> out
                         of the <span class="reg">brass</span> furnaces of Cyprus: but <span class="reg">no</span> man <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">believed</span> this true, except
                         by an allegory: For fire, if it be continued, <span class="reg">destroys</span> and corrupts the
                         <span class="reg">bodies</span> of all <span class="reg">animals</span> whatsoever, it <span class="reg">also</span> burning the earth into <span class="reg">glass</span>,
                         and the most solid timber into ashes, and all other compounded things,
                         a few excepted, as <span class="reg">Mercurial</span>, which <span class="reg">do</span> either <span class="reg">wholly</span>
         <span class="reg">remain</span>, or <span class="reg">altogether</span>
         <span class="reg">fly</span> from fire, <span class="reg">no</span> separation of the parts being made in them:
                         Vulcan is a most <span class="reg">cruel</span>
         <span class="reg">murderer</span>, who calls all things mixed with the
                         Elements to his examination, some being excepted from his judgement
                         seat as the <span class="reg">privileges</span>, and prerogatives of the <span class="reg">Emperess</span> Nature: Upon
                         these <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">obtains</span>
         <span class="reg">no</span> right alone, <span class="reg">unless</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">join</span> to <span class="reg">himself</span> other <span class="pb">94</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 29.</span> judges, and Salamanders are above his violence, which they <span class="reg">do</span> not fear:  Avicenne in Porta reckons up the various temperaments of <span class="reg">bodies</span>, which are
                         all <span class="reg">unequal</span>, and therefore corruptible by fire and other <span class="reg">injuries</span>: but one
                         <span class="reg">he</span> affirms to be exactly <span class="reg">equal</span>, which <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> much heat, as cold, <span class="reg">so</span> much siccity, as moisture, not as to weight, but justice, as the <span class="reg">Physicians</span> 
         <span class="reg">term</span> it, and this is that which is more patient, than agent; in which if
                         fire <span class="reg">endeavors</span> to dissolve water its contrary into <span class="reg">air</span> its familiar, the
                         earth <span class="reg">admits</span> not this resolution, because it is incorporated with water:  and the <span class="reg">internal</span> fire of the compound <span class="reg">does</span> by consent approve this
                         sentiment of the earth, because it is an intimate <span class="reg">friend</span> to the earth.  The <span class="reg">judgment</span> therefore of Vulcan <span class="reg">ceases</span>, who <span class="reg">uses</span> yet another <span class="reg">intrigue</span>, striving to <span class="reg">burn</span> the earth into ashes, as his <span class="reg">custom</span> is, but the water <span class="reg">adhering</span> to it <span class="reg">prevails</span> against exceptions, which <span class="reg">Shows</span>
         <span class="reg">itself</span> united to the earth, and the <span class="reg">air</span> to it, and fire to the earth on the other  side; <span class="reg">he</span> therefore that would incinerate the earth, must <span class="reg">also</span> incinerate the other Elements: And <span class="reg">so</span> Vulcan being <span class="reg">disappointed</span> suspends  his <span class="reg">judgment</span>, lest <span class="reg">he</span> Should be derided by all men. This body is like
                         the <span class="reg">real</span> Salamander, in which the Elements are exactly <span class="reg">equalized</span> in virtue: Of it <span class="reg">Says</span> the Rosary out of Geber; That Philosopher would have  the substance of Mercury <span class="reg">mortified</span>, but naturally his Mercury is in that
                         venerable Stone, as is manifest to all men: therefore etc. <span class="reg">Also</span> that Philosopher would have the substance of Mercury fixed, as is evident, because <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">teaches</span> the <span class="reg">ways</span> of fixing with many cautions and devices,
                         but who doubts the substance of that <span class="reg">precious</span> stone to be fixed? certainly <span class="reg">no</span> man that <span class="reg">knows</span> it. By which it is demonstrated, that the
                         Stone must be reduced to the nature of the Salamander by fixation; that is, to absolute fixity, which declines not, or <span class="reg">refuses</span> fire.  For neither can it be the Salamander, before it <span class="reg">has</span> learned to endure fire most patiently, which must of necessity be effected in long
                         <span class="reg">process</span> of time. Hereafter in the 35 <span class="reg">emblematical</span> discourse <span class="reg">we</span> will  treat of Achilles and Triptolemus, placed in the night time under embers
                         of fire, till they could endure most vehement heat, who <span class="reg">also</span> attained to a
                         Salamandrine property by <span class="reg">custom</span> and habit: for <span class="reg">custom</span> is a second  nature, which notwithstanding must <span class="reg">communicate</span> power, and as a <span class="reg">Mistress</span> begin alteration, otherwise <span class="reg">custom</span> will be able to effect little or
                         nothing; that is the reason why it is impossible to fix ice at fire, but
                         <span class="reg">Cristal</span> possible, because nature <span class="reg">has</span> begun this: The same must be
                         supposed of <span class="reg">watery</span> and volatile Mercury, which in its <span class="reg">own</span> nature
                         cannot be fixed, except by <span class="reg">marriage</span> and coition with Sulphur,  which is the Philosophers tincture, and <span class="reg">fixes</span> all volatile Spirits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</div>
