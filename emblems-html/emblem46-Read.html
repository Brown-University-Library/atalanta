      <div class="ab"> Cicero in his <span class="reg">book</span> of the nature of the Gods declares the most ancient <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> Apollo to be the <span class="reg">Son</span> of Vulcan, and keeper of Athens: Which opinion,
                         if it be, as it ought, <span class="reg">transferred</span> to an Allegory, is indeed most true; because
                         Vulcan <span class="reg">produces</span> the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> Sol, which is Apollo. But it <span class="reg">has</span> 
         <span class="reg">prevailed</span>, that <span class="reg">he</span> was <span class="reg">born</span> of Jupiter; and that Latona having two
                         children in her <span class="reg">womb</span>, Apollo and Diana, which <span class="reg">she</span>
         <span class="reg">conceived</span> of Jupiter, Juno being jealous sent Python a Serpent of prodigious magnitude and malice, to persecute and perplex her being great with child.  The miserable woman after tedious <span class="reg">wanderings</span> was at length brought
                         by a <span class="reg">Ship</span> to the Island Ortygia, to her sister Asteries, who therein
                         reigned: And that Island, being <span class="reg">almost</span> all overflowed with the Sea,
                         gave place to Latona being in <span class="reg">travail</span>, whereupon it was called Delos,  which before was Ἂδηλος: There therefore being in <span class="reg">labor</span>, first came forth
                         Diana, and <span class="reg">she</span> did the office of a midwife to her mother <span class="reg">laboring</span> to bring forth her brother Apollo; From whence it came to <span class="reg">pass</span> that women going with Child did in the time of their <span class="reg">labor</span> invoke her deity, and <span class="reg">called</span> her either Lucina or Ilithya, because <span class="reg">she</span>
         <span class="reg">showed</span> light to infants <span class="reg">born</span> their eyes being opened:
                         Apollo therefore being <span class="reg">born</span> and <span class="reg">grown</span> up slew Python the tormenter of his mother with arrows, and <span class="reg">killed</span> the Cyclopes because  they made <span class="reg">lightning</span> for Jupiter to destroy his <span class="reg">Son</span>
         <span class="reg">Aesculapius</span>,
                         <span class="reg">whom</span> Jupiter condemned to hell blasted with <span class="reg">lightning</span>, because
                         <span class="reg">he</span> had <span class="reg">restored</span> Hippolytus to life being <span class="reg">torn</span> in <span class="reg">pieces</span> by horses.
                         <span class="reg">We</span> have in many places demonstrated these things to be merely
                         <span class="reg">Chymical</span>: For Latona, Cynthia, Apollo, and Python are requisites of
                         the art, which have such a relation one to the other, as <span class="reg">has</span> been
                         declared; but these things being divulged in the writings of the most
                         ancient <span class="reg">Poets</span>, as Orpheus, Linus, <span class="reg">Musaeus</span>, Homer, etc. have given the
                         ignorant occasion to ascribe religion and veneration to Apollo: Hereupon Apollo is in many places of Europe and Asia worshipped,  and innumerable temples erected to him; And especially at Delphos
                         <span class="reg">he</span> had a temple to be worshipped by ancient religion, wherein a great
                         number of statues made of solid gold and silver or great weight  and artifice was reposited by Kings and Princes, with other most
                         <span class="reg">precious</span> gifts, which were hidden in sacred places for religion sake
                         by men of all degrees. Pausanias reports that a brazen Skeleton of
                         admirable artifice was hung at the top of the temple by Hippocrates.
                         That famous Tripos was <span class="reg">also</span> consecrated to Apollo by Pelops, at the
                         time when <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">married</span> Hippodamia the daughter <span class="reg">Oenomaus</span> King
                         of Elis, which Tripos Mulciber made, and gave to Pelops: It was
                         erected in the <span class="reg">middle</span> of the temple, in which Pythia sitting
                        
                        
                        
                        <span class="pb">145</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 46.</span> 
         <span class="reg">received</span> the inspiration of the <span class="reg">Devil</span> gaping with a wide mouth, and then  <span class="reg">prophesied</span>, and gave responses to those that <span class="reg">desired</span> to know the events of things
                         to come: Delphos was indeed in <span class="reg">Boeotica</span> seated about the foot of Parnassus.  Near to the temple was the divining <span class="reg">fountain</span>, named Cassiotis, which, if burning torches was brought to it, did extinguish them: if they were removed
                         <span class="reg">far</span>
         <span class="reg">off</span>, they were suddenly kindled, and <span class="reg">took</span> fire; and the water of  that <span class="reg">fountain</span> being <span class="reg">drank</span>
         <span class="reg">yielded</span> the virtue of divining, but notwithstanding the drinkers of that water were made of shorter life. Concourse therefore being made from all parts of Europe and Asia to the  <span class="reg">Delphic</span> Oracle, the Poets <span class="reg">feign</span> that place, namely Parnassus to be  in the <span class="reg">middle</span> of the earth, and that they proved by an example of Jupiter, who had experimented it by sending forth two Eagles: But this thing
                         not being supported by the reputation of history, it is not derogatory from the
                         truth, to ascribe it to <span class="reg">Chymical</span> matters, especially Apollo being, as <span class="reg">has</span> been  declared, <span class="reg">altogether</span>
         <span class="reg">Chymical</span> by <span class="reg">original</span>, though the <span class="reg">Devil</span> afterwards  confirmed the superstition of men, and gave <span class="reg">prophesies</span> under that name.
                         The two Eagles are two stones, whereof one comes from the East, the  other from the West, which the Philosophers have many <span class="reg">ways</span> demonstrated. Jupiter sends them forth, as his <span class="reg">Ensignbearers</span>. The Eagle seems indeed a <span class="reg">friend</span> to Apollo or the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, in proving her chickens at the <span class="reg">Sun</span>,  which if they cannot endure, <span class="reg">She</span>
         <span class="reg">disowns</span> them as illegitimate. Its feathers
                         being <span class="reg">joined</span> with other things are <span class="reg">said</span> not to putrefy, and to <span class="reg">devour</span> the feathers of other birds, easily admitting gilding <span class="reg">also</span>: By old age, or
                         <span class="reg">sickness</span> it <span class="reg">dies</span> not, but by famine; For the upper <span class="reg">beak</span>
         <span class="reg">grows</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> crooked that it cannot receive food: Which having cast off it <span class="reg">plunges</span>
         <span class="reg">itself</span> three times in a <span class="reg">fountain</span>, and <span class="reg">so</span> is <span class="reg">said</span> to <span class="reg">return</span> to youth.  Hereupon <span class="reg">says</span> the Psalmist: Your youth shall be renewed as the  youth of an Eagle: This of all birds is never affected with <span class="reg">Lightning</span>:
                         It <span class="reg">wars</span> with the dragon, which hunts after its eggs for the sake of  them: All the endowments of whose nature have <span class="reg">afforded</span> the Philosophers reason to <span class="reg">predicate</span> the Eagle in their art, and assimilate the
                         stone to it, whereof innumerable examples being obvious in their  books, <span class="reg">we</span> will not here <span class="reg">alleged</span> more . . . . . . . . . .</div>
