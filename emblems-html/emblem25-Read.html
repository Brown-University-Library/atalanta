      <div class="ab"> In acquiring the golden fleece the Dragon was first of all to be killed, because <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> the <span class="reg">labor</span> being attempted by many men, they were overcome by the Dragon  and <span class="reg">destroyed</span> with deadly <span class="reg">poison</span>: the reason was, because they were not sufficiently
                         armed against the dragons <span class="reg">poison</span>, nor instructed, by what <span class="reg">intrigue</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> might be <span class="reg">slain</span>: but Jason (the <span class="reg">Physician</span>) neglected <span class="reg">no</span> manner of <span class="reg">remedies</span>, whereof <span class="reg">he</span> received <span class="reg">several</span> from Medea (the advice of the mind) and  amongst those the images of Sol and Luna, which using <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">successfully</span>
         <span class="reg">obtained</span> the victory with the reward, that is, the Golden Fleece. The Dragon therefore was <span class="reg">slain</span> by Sol and Luna, or the images of them, which the Philosophers
                         <span class="reg">do</span> in many places inculcate: for an Author of the Rosary amongst others <span class="reg">has</span> it
                         thus: Hermes; The Dragon <span class="reg">dies</span> not, except <span class="reg">he</span> be <span class="reg">killed</span> by his brother and Sister,
                         not by one alone but by both together, to <span class="reg">wit</span>, by Sol and Luna. The Philosophers Mercury never <span class="reg">dies</span>, except <span class="reg">he</span> be <span class="reg">killed</span> by his Sister, that is, <span class="reg">he</span> must be
                         <span class="reg">congealed</span> by Luna or Sol. Note, that the Dragon is Argent vive extracted from <span class="reg">bodies</span>, having in it body, <span class="reg">Soul</span>, and Spirit, whereupon <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">says</span>: The Dragon <span class="reg">dies</span> not, except by his brother and Sister, that is, Sol and Luna, that is, Sulphur extracted, containing in it the nature of <span class="reg">moistness</span> and <span class="reg">coldness</span> according to Luna,
                         by those the dragon <span class="reg">dies</span>, that is, Argent vive extracted from the same <span class="reg">bodies</span> at  first, which is the Philosophers Aqua permanens, which is made after putrefaction, and after separation of the Elements, and that water is by another  name called Aqua f≈ìtida: these are his words: with <span class="reg">whom</span> all the rest <span class="reg">do</span> agree, <span class="reg">so</span> that there is <span class="reg">no</span> need to <span class="reg">alleged</span> the authority of every one: the
                         Epyreans <span class="reg">worshiped</span> the Dragon in the temple of Apollo in <span class="reg">commemoration</span> of  Python being <span class="reg">slain</span>: <span class="reg">War</span> and hatred is genuine to the dragon with the Elephant, whose eyes and throat <span class="reg">he</span> strikes at, till the Elephant falling on the  ground kills the dragon with <span class="reg">himself</span> by the weight of his body, by which means
                         dragons blood is imported into our <span class="reg">countries</span>: The Dragon <span class="reg">has</span> eyes of the valuation of <span class="reg">gems</span>: his sight is very acute and clear, and therefore <span class="reg">he</span> is much
                         used for the keeping of treasures, as the apples of the Hesperides, and the golden fleece at Colchos <span class="reg">aforesaid</span>: The Ancients <span class="reg">ascribed</span> a dragon to <span class="reg">Asculapius</span> as a <span class="reg">Hieroglyphic</span>: But the Chymists <span class="reg">do</span> appropriate dragons to their operations, not indeed really, but allegorically: for a dragon, whether <span class="reg">he</span> be <span class="reg">fixed</span> or volatile, <span class="reg">always</span> denotes Mercury: for this reason Mercury is to be seen with
                         two serpents twisted about his wand (the Dragon being a great Serpent) and <span class="reg">Saturn</span> with one, which <span class="reg">devours</span> his <span class="reg">tail</span>, as <span class="reg">also</span> Janus: A Serpent is consecrated to <span class="reg">Asculapius</span> the <span class="reg">Son</span> of Apollo, the <span class="reg">inventor</span> of medicine (<span class="reg">Philosophical</span> medicine) in which <span class="reg">form</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> is reported to be brought from Epidaurus to Rome, and there <span class="reg">always</span>
         <span class="reg">worshiped</span> for the cessation of the  pestilence caused by him, as was supposed: But the Philosophers dragon is
                         <span class="reg">always</span> most vigilant and lively, nor easily to be wounded, both by reason of the <span class="reg">thickness</span> of his <span class="reg">skin</span>, and the <span class="reg">sharpness</span> of his teeth  and <span class="reg">poison</span>, wherewith <span class="reg">he</span> is armed: For though <span class="reg">common</span> dragons are <span class="reg">said</span> to be <span class="reg">void</span> of <span class="reg">poison</span>, yet this is not without it, venting it upon any one
                        
                        <span class="pb">82</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 25.</span> in his way, if <span class="reg">he</span> be not warily managed: <span class="reg">He</span> can therefore be rarely overcome by force, except the craft of his consanguine relations be <span class="reg">also</span> added: For
                         the Poet <span class="reg">said</span>
         <span class="reg">truly</span>, It is a safe and <span class="reg">usual</span> way to deceive by the name  of a <span class="reg">friend</span>, yet though it be a safe and <span class="reg">usual</span> way, it is a crime, which is <span class="reg">so</span> 
         <span class="reg">elsewhere</span>, and in other businesses, not here. <span class="reg">Jugglers</span> and Mountebanks are <span class="reg">said</span> to  kill and <span class="reg">expel</span>
         <span class="reg">worms</span> out of children by the powder of such other <span class="reg">worms</span>, that
                         is, brethren by brothers and Sisters, <span class="reg">so</span> here the dragon must be killed by the
                         brother and Sister together, that is, by Sol and Luna: from whence it appears
                         that the dragon is <span class="reg">also</span> one of the <span class="reg">Planets</span>, to <span class="reg">wit</span>, Mercury extracted from
                         <span class="reg">bodies</span>, as <span class="reg">has</span> been <span class="reg">already</span> manifested by the Rosary: Some of the <span class="reg">Grecians</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">affirm</span>, that, in the <span class="reg">reign</span> of <span class="reg">Herod</span> King of <span class="reg">Judea</span>, a dragon  fell in love with a <span class="reg">marriageable</span> and <span class="reg">beautiful</span>
         <span class="reg">maid</span>, and lay with her in bed,
                         and that Tiberius the <span class="reg">Emperor</span> delighted in another, which <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">commonly</span> fed with his <span class="reg">own</span> hand: <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> dragon, if <span class="reg">he</span> be  rightly handled, leaves his <span class="reg">fierceness</span>, and becomes a <span class="reg">friend</span> to man, though
                         <span class="reg">he</span> be <span class="reg">malicious</span>, if otherwise. Xanthus the historian is a <span class="reg">witness</span> with  Pliny, that the young of a dragon being <span class="reg">killed</span> was restored by the parent
                         to life with the <span class="reg">herb</span>, which <span class="reg">he</span> calls Balin: which notwithstanding I ascribe to a <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> allegory, rather than true history, for life is <span class="reg">restored</span> to a dead dragon, and death to a living by course in <span class="reg">Chymical</span> processes <span class="reg">only</span>:
                         But some man may enquire, where and how the dragon must be taken?  The Philosophers answer by a verse most concisely,
                        Dant Rebis montes, dracones, terraq, fontes: But you may see Tacitus of the way of taking him, with what care and
                         industry many men <span class="reg">watched</span> to take a mighty dragon <span class="reg">observed</span> in Africa,
                         and bring him to the <span class="reg">Emperor</span> Tiberius, namely the dragons accustomed way amongst stones being enclosed and by degrees straightened,  where <span class="reg">he</span> was <span class="reg">stopped</span> by <span class="reg">nets</span> and cords, and at length made tame by clubs  and stripes, and as a <span class="reg">burden</span> of many carts brought to a ship, in which <span class="reg">he</span> was <span class="reg">carried</span> to Rome . . . . . . . . . . .</div>
