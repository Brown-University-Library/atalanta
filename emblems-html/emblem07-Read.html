         <span class="milestone">e07-01</span>What Hippocrates, the defender and propugnator of <span class="reg">Physicians</span>, affirms of humors, that they are different and many in man, and not one <span class="reg">only</span>, otherwise
                         various diseases, could not arise, that <span class="reg">we</span> perceive to be true of the elements
                         of the world: <span class="milestone">e07-02</span>for if there was but one <span class="reg">only</span> element, there could be <span class="reg">no</span> mutation of it into another, <span class="reg">no</span> generation nor corruption, yea all things
                         would be one immutable thing, and <span class="reg">no</span> meteors, <span class="reg">minerals</span>, plants, and
                         <span class="reg">animals</span> could be naturally from thence produced. <span class="milestone">e07-03</span>For this reason the supreme Creator composed the whole <span class="reg">system</span> of this world of <span class="reg">diverse</span> and  contrary natures, namely of light and heavy, <span class="reg">hot</span> and cold, moist and dry  that one might by affinity <span class="reg">pass</span> into the other, and <span class="reg">so</span> a composition be
                         made of <span class="reg">bodies</span>, which might be very different one from another in essence,
                         <span class="reg">qualities</span>, virtues, and effects: <span class="milestone">e07-04</span>for in things perfectly mixed are the light Elements, as fire and <span class="reg">air</span>, and <span class="reg">also</span> the heavy, as earth and water, which are <span class="reg">so</span> 
         <span class="reg">equally</span> tempered together, that one recedes not from the other, but suffers <span class="reg">itself</span> to be easily taken and held by the other as <span class="reg">neighbor</span> by <span class="reg">neighbor</span>: <span class="milestone">e07-05</span>Earth and <span class="reg">air</span> are contrary one to the other, <span class="reg">so</span> fire and water, yet notwithstanding fire <span class="reg">maintains</span>
         <span class="reg">friendship</span> with <span class="reg">air</span> by heat <span class="reg">common</span> to both, with earth by siccity: <span class="reg">so</span> 
         <span class="reg">air</span> with water, and water with earth: <span class="milestone">e07-06</span>by which means they are all <span class="reg">joined</span> by bonds of affinity or rather consanguinity, and <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">remain</span> together in
                         one composition, which, if it abound with the light Elements, elevates the  heavy with it, if with the heavy, weighs <span class="reg">down</span> the light with it: <span class="milestone">e07-07</span>This is declared by the two Eagles, one with wings, the other without, of which that  which <span class="reg">endeavored</span> to fly is restrained by the <span class="add">other</span>
         <span class="milestone">e07-08</span>an example hereof is evident
                         in the fight of the Falcon and Heron, for the Falcon soaring higher in  the <span class="reg">air</span> by his Speedy flying, takes and tears the Heron with his Talons, by
                         whose weight both fall to the ground: <span class="milestone">e07-09</span>The contrary appeared in the  <span class="reg">artificial</span> dove or Automa of Archytas, where heavy things were lifted up
                         by light, that is, the wooden body of it <span class="reg">carried</span> into the <span class="reg">air</span> by the  Spirit included within: <span class="milestone">e07-10</span>In the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> subject the light things <span class="reg">do</span> first <span class="reg">predominate</span> the heavy, as to plenty, but they are overcome by virtue of the heavy things, and in processe of time the Eagles wings are cut  <span class="reg">off</span>, and one very great bird (namely an Ostrich) is made of two, which
                         can consume iron, and which being impeded by weight <span class="reg">runs</span> more upon
                         the earth, than <span class="reg">flys</span> in the <span class="reg">air</span>, though it <span class="reg">has</span> goodly wings: <span class="milestone">e07-11</span>Concerning
                         this or the like Hermes (as the Author of Aurora chapt. 5. affirms) writes thus:
                         I have considered a bird worthy to be had in estimation by the wise, which
                         <span class="reg">flys</span> when it is in Aries, Cancer, Libra, or <span class="reg">Capricorn</span>, and you will never
                         <span class="reg">fail</span> of it in pure <span class="reg">mines</span>, and rocky mountains: <span class="milestone">e07-12</span>Concerning the same Senior in Tabula, where two are seen, one volatile the other without wings,
                         whereof one holds the others <span class="reg">tail</span> by its <span class="reg">beak</span>, that they cannot easily be
                         seperated: <span class="milestone">e07-13</span>For this is the device and machination of <span class="reg">universal</span> nature,
                         <span class="reg">always</span> to <span class="reg">raise</span> heavy things by light, and likewise to <span class="reg">depress</span> light
                         things by heavy, as the Author of the perfect Magistery <span class="reg">declares</span>, who
                         constitutes seven <span class="reg">mineral</span> spirits, as it were <span class="reg">erratic</span>
         <span class="reg">Stars</span>, and <span class="pb">28</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 7.</span> 
         <span class="reg">so</span> many <span class="reg">metallic</span>
         <span class="reg">bodies</span>, as fixed <span class="reg">Stars</span>, and <span class="reg">enjoins</span> these to be
                         wedded to those: <span class="milestone">e07-14</span>from thence <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="underline">Aristotle</span> the <span class="underline">Chymist</span>, the Spirit, <span class="reg">says</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span>,
                         having dissolved the body and <span class="reg">Soul</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> as to exist in their <span class="reg">form</span>, <span class="reg">does</span> not
                         <span class="reg">remain</span> a fixed thing, <span class="reg">unless</span> you operate upon it: <span class="milestone">e07-15</span>now operation is to <span class="reg">join</span> it with the body, from which you <span class="reg">prepared</span> it at first: because the Spirit is  thereby prevented from flight being mixed with the supersistences of the  body: the light Elements, namely <span class="reg">air</span> and fire, as a learned man declares,
                         <span class="milestone">e07-16</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> in Camphore oversway the heavy; and therefore it is <span class="reg">said</span>
         <span class="reg">wholly</span> to exhale and evaporate into <span class="reg">air</span>. <span class="milestone">e07-17</span>In Argent vive, the flowers of Sulphur, Antimony, the Salt of Harts blood, Sal Armoniacke, and such others, the earth  <span class="reg">flys</span> with the <span class="reg">air</span> into the <span class="reg">Alembic</span>, and is not seperated from it. <span class="milestone">e07-18</span>In Gold,
                         <span class="reg">glass</span>, Diamond, the Stone Smyris, Granats, and the like, the Elements  <span class="reg">do</span> notwithstanding fire <span class="reg">remain</span>
         <span class="reg">a long</span> time <span class="reg">joined</span> without detriment,  and the earth <span class="reg">retains</span> those things which are left in <span class="reg">itself</span>. <span class="milestone">e07-19</span>In other combustibles division and separation of one thing from another is effected, <span class="reg">so</span> that the ashes are left in the <span class="reg">bottom</span>, the water, <span class="reg">air</span>, and fire fly upwards: <span class="milestone">e07-20</span>
         <span class="reg">we</span> must not therefore have respect to the <span class="reg">unequal</span> composition of
                         these last, being not <span class="reg">so</span> strongly <span class="reg">mixed</span>, nor to the <span class="reg">commixtion</span> of the first,
                         though more durable, yet volatile, but to the solidity, constancy, and fixity
                         of the <span class="reg">middle</span>: for <span class="reg">so</span> the bird without wings will <span class="reg">detain</span> that which <span class="reg">has</span>,  and the fixed substance will fix the volatile, which must necessarily be
                         done . . . . . . . . . .</div>
