         <span class="reg">laws</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> both forbid those people to marry, who are by  nature <span class="reg">joined</span> in too near a degree of consanguinity, such namely as <span class="add">directly</span> ascend and descend in a <span class="reg">genealogical</span> line, and that for very good considerations; <span class="milestone">e04-02</span>but when the  Philosophers <span class="reg">speak</span> of the mother to be <span class="reg">joined</span> with the <span class="reg">Son</span>, or father with the
                   daughter, or of the brother with the Sister, they neither say or <span class="reg">do</span> anything contrary
                   to the <span class="reg">said</span> laws: because subjects distinguish attributes and causes effects; <span class="milestone">e04-03</span>for the
                   persons of Philosophers are <span class="add">as</span> free from those differences as <span class="del">well as</span> the <span class="reg">Sons</span> and daughters of Adam, who <span class="reg">married</span> one with another without the imputation of any  crime: <span class="milestone">e04-04</span>but the <span class="reg">principal</span> reason seems to be, that mankind might be more  firmly united and linked in affinity and <span class="reg">friendship</span>, and not <span class="del">be</span> divided into  <span class="reg">inimical</span> and <span class="reg">hereditary</span> factions of <span class="reg">families</span>: <span class="milestone">e04-05</span>the same reason remaining  <span class="reg">firm</span> and entire in the first <span class="reg">Sons</span> and daughters of Adam, did not as all <span class="reg">debar</span> them from the <span class="subst">

            <span class="note-mark">*</span>rites</div> them alone, and <span class="reg">no</span> others were living besides them, and their parents, and  therefore as <span class="reg">allied</span> in blood, <span class="reg">so</span> necessarily were they <span class="reg">joined</span> in affinity: but
                   a multitude of men increasing, and being distributed into innumerable <span class="reg">families</span>, this was found a true and just cause why brothers Should not marry
                   Sisters: <span class="milestone">e04-07</span>The Philosophers have another reason, why Sisters may marry
                   brothers, namely the similitude of substance, that it may be <span class="reg">joined</span> to  the like: <span class="milestone">e04-08</span>but in this kind there are onely two like one another as to species,
                   different as to sex, whereof one is saluted by the name of brother, the  other of sister: they therefore may be the same both liberty and condition, yea and inevitable necessity, as the first consanguine men, be lawfully
                   <span class="reg">committed</span> to one matrimony: <span class="milestone">e04-09</span>the brother is <span class="reg">hot</span> and dry, and therefore very <span class="reg">choleric</span>; the Sister is cold and moist, having much <span class="reg">phlegmatic</span> matter in her: which natures <span class="reg">so</span> differing in temper <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">commonly</span> best  agree in love and <span class="reg">fruitfulness</span>, and the propagation of Children: <span class="milestone">e04-10</span>for as
                   fire, which may be propagated, is not easily <span class="reg">struck</span> out of the most hard
                   body Steel and Steel, nor out of the brittle flint and flint, but out of hard
                   and brittle, that is, steel and flint, <span class="reg">so</span> a lively offspring is not produced from a <span class="reg">hot</span> man and fiery woman, as neither from both cold (for the
                   <span class="reg">coldness</span> of the man is <span class="reg">barrenness</span>) but from him <span class="reg">hot</span>, her more cold,  <span class="milestone">e04-11</span>for, in the latitude of <span class="reg">human</span> temperament, the hottest woman is concluded colder than the coldest man of his sex, if sound, as Lev. Lemnius
                   in lib. de occ. nat. mirac. proves: the Sister therefore and brother are
                   rightly <span class="reg">joined</span> together by the Philosophers: <span class="milestone">e04-12</span>If a man defines offspring
                   from a <span class="reg">hen</span>, bitch, <span class="reg">She</span> goat, Ewe, or other brutes, <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">joins</span> a <span class="del">
            <span class="reg">dog</span>
         </span> 
         <span class="reg">cock</span>, <span class="reg">dog</span>, <span class="reg">he</span> goat, <span class="reg">ram</span>, every <span class="reg">animal</span>
         <span class="underline">to its Speci</span>es, to w<span class="underline">hich it is</span> m<span class="underline">ost li</span>ke, and <span class="reg">so</span> is not frustrated of his desire; nor indeed <span class="reg">does</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> respect the consanguinity of brutes, but <span class="reg">only</span> the generosity of every
                   one, and the congruity of nature: <span class="reg">So</span> may it be <span class="reg">said</span> of the body of a tree,
                   and the <span class="reg">slip</span> to be therein grafted, <span class="milestone">e04-13</span>yea of the metallicke <span class="pb">19</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 4.</span> nature, which notwithstanding as it <span class="reg">has</span> of all things the greatest  similitude and homogeneity of substance, <span class="reg">does</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> require, where it
                   desires a thing to be <span class="reg">joined</span> with it: <span class="milestone">e04-14</span>But brother and Sister being <span class="reg">joined</span> together, <span class="reg">do</span> not become <span class="reg">fruitful</span>, nor persist long in love, except a Philothesium, or cup of <span class="reg">love</span> be <span class="reg">administered</span> to them like an amorous potion:  for their minds are hereby <span class="reg">so</span> quieted and united, that (laying aside modesty) they <span class="reg">do</span> as it were <span class="reg">drunk</span> (like Lot) <span class="reg">go</span> together, and procreate  an offspring (not spurious but) legitimate: <span class="milestone">e04-15</span>For who <span class="reg">knows</span> not that mankind is very much obliged to medicine, because many thousands of men  are now in the world, which would not have been, if their fathers or forefathers had not by the means and benefit thereof been freed and delivered
                   from the defect of sterility, or their mothers <span class="add">
            <span class="reg">preserved</span>
         </span> from abortion, by removing  and taking away the cause, or the nearest, and remote impediment? <span class="milestone">e04-16</span>This
                   cup of love is therfore given to this new <span class="reg">married</span> couple for the same reasons,
                   which any man may hereby plainly understand are three, that is to say,  constancy of love, remotion of sterility, and <span class="reg">prevention</span> of abortion . .</div>
