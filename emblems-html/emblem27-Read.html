      <div class="ab"> Concerning Erichthonius they write, that <span class="reg">he</span> sprung from the seed of Vulcan <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> cast upon the earth striving with Pallas the <span class="reg">Goddess</span> of <span class="reg">wisdom</span>, with serpentine and without <span class="reg">human</span> feet. Very like him are those, who, depending upon
                         the means of Vulcan alone, without the <span class="reg">wisdom</span> of Pallas, <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">beget</span> monstrous
                         children, namely, without feet and abortive, which can neither <span class="reg">sustain</span> themselves, nor profit others: It is a miserable thing for a man to <span class="reg">go</span> on all
                         <span class="reg">four</span>, that is, hands and feet together, but much more miserable to be <span class="reg">altogether</span> destitute of feet, and to use <span class="reg">arms</span> instead thereof: for they seem to
                         have degenerated to the nature of <span class="reg">worms</span>, who <span class="reg">go</span> after the manner of <span class="reg">creeping</span>
         <span class="reg">worms</span>: But the two <span class="reg">legs</span> are the <span class="reg">organic</span> parts in man, without which
                         <span class="reg">he</span> cannot <span class="reg">truly</span>
         <span class="reg">walk</span>, as neither see without eyes, or touch things tangible
                         without hands: <span class="reg">so</span> likewise Medicine and every operative art is <span class="reg">supposed</span> to
                         have two <span class="reg">legs</span>, whereon to stand, namely experience and reason, without  either of which that art is lame, and imperfect in its traditions and <span class="reg">precepts</span>, nor correspondent to the proposed end: Chymistry indeed <span class="reg">chiefly</span> delights in two subjects (as <span class="reg">legs</span>) whereof one is the key, the other the string of
                         the <span class="reg">bar</span>; by these the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> Rosary <span class="reg">locked</span> on all sides is opened,  and passage admitted into it to those that have right to enter: But if one
                         be wanting to him that is about to enter herein it will be the same thing, as
                         for a man whose feet are bound to <span class="reg">endeavor</span> to <span class="reg">outrun</span> a hare: <span class="reg">he</span> that
                         enters into the garden, which is every way enclosed or fenced, without a Key,
                         imitates a <span class="reg">thief</span>, who coming in a <span class="reg">dark</span> night can <span class="reg">discern</span> nothing that  <span class="reg">grows</span> in the garden, nor enjoy the things stolen away: But the key is a thing
                         of very little <span class="reg">esteem</span> or value, which is properly called a stone <span class="reg">known</span> in the
                         chapters, and is the root of Rhodes, without which a twig is not put forth, nor  <span class="reg">does</span> the bud swell, nor the Rose become green, or discover multitude of  leaves: But a <span class="reg">question</span> might be <span class="reg">asked</span>, where must this key be sought for?
                         I anwser with the oracle, that is must be there investigated, where the  bones of Orestes are <span class="reg">said</span> to be found, namely, where winds, the Striker, that
                         which is beaten <span class="reg">back</span>, and the destruction of men are found together, that is,
                         as Lychas <span class="reg">has</span> interpreted it, in the Brasiers Shop or <span class="reg">workhouse</span>: For the oracle
                         would have <span class="reg">bellows</span> understood by winds; a hammer by the striker an <span class="reg">anvil</span> by that which is beaten <span class="reg">back</span>; by the destruction of men iron: if a man <span class="reg">knows</span> how to number well and distinguish the signs, <span class="reg">he</span> will certainly find this key
                         in the <span class="reg">northern</span> hemisphere of the <span class="reg">Zodiac</span>, and the string of the <span class="reg">bar</span> in
                         the <span class="reg">Southern</span>: Which having <span class="reg">obtained</span>, it will be easy to open the <span class="reg">door</span> and enter:
                         and in the very entrance <span class="reg">he</span> will see Venus with her Paramour Adonis: for <span class="reg">she</span> 
         <span class="reg">has</span> tinged the white roses of a purple <span class="reg">color</span> with her blood: In the same place
                         <span class="reg">also</span> a dragon is observed, as in the Hesperian gardens, which <span class="reg">watches</span> to <span class="reg">preserve</span> the roses: The scent of the roses is <span class="reg">said</span> to be increased by <span class="reg">garlic</span> planted near, and that by reason of an <span class="reg">exceeding</span> degree of heat, which appears
                         in <span class="reg">garlic</span>, in which respect it is a remedy against cold <span class="reg">poisons</span>: for Roses <span class="pb">88</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 27.</span> require the heat of the <span class="reg">Sun</span> and earth, before they can <span class="reg">attain</span> to <span class="reg">color</span> and
                         scent most <span class="reg">grateful</span> to the eyes and nose: Moreover the fume of <span class="reg">common</span> Sulphur
                         makes red roses white, where it <span class="reg">touches</span>, on the contrary the spirit of <span class="reg">Vitriol</span> or Aqua fortis restores them to a deep red <span class="reg">color</span>, which <span class="reg">endures</span>: For <span class="reg">common</span> Sulphur is an enemy to the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> Sulphur, though it cannot destroy it,
                         but the Solutive water is <span class="reg">friendly</span>, and <span class="reg">preserves</span> its <span class="reg">color</span>: The rose is consecrated to Venus in regard of beauty, in which it <span class="reg">surpasses</span> all other flowers:  for it is a Virgin, which nature <span class="reg">has</span> armed, that it might not be violated without revenge and <span class="reg">punishment</span>: Violets are <span class="reg">void</span> of weapons, and trodden under
                         foot; Roses being comprised within prickles have yellow <span class="reg">hair</span> inwardly; and
                         outwardly a green garment: <span class="reg">No</span> man can <span class="reg">pluck</span>, and separate them from  the prickles but <span class="reg">he</span> that is wife [sic], if otherwise, <span class="reg">he</span> will <span class="reg">feel</span> a sting in his  fingers: <span class="reg">So</span> none but a most wary Philosopher will <span class="reg">pluck</span> the flowers, except <span class="reg">he</span> would find bees and stings in the hives, and gall with honey. Many  men have secretly and feloniously <span class="reg">entered</span> into the Rosary, but reaped nothing  from thence but misery; that is, lost their <span class="reg">labor</span>. Hereupon <span class="reg">Says</span> Bacusser in  Turba; Our <span class="reg">books</span>
         <span class="reg">seem</span> to be very injurious to those, who read our writings
                         <span class="reg">only</span> once, twice, or thrice, whereas being frustrated in their understanding and  whose study, they <span class="reg">also</span> (which is worst) <span class="reg">lose</span> their <span class="reg">money</span>, <span class="reg">pains</span>, and time, if
                         they have spent any in this art. And a little after, For when a man thinks <span class="reg">he</span> 
         <span class="reg">has</span> done, <span class="reg">has</span> the world, <span class="reg">he</span> will find nothing his hands . . . . .</div>
