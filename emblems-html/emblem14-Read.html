      <div class="ab"> It is a saying of the Ancients, that a Serpent, which <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">devoured</span> a Serpent, be<span class="milestone">e03-01</span>comes a Dragon: for it is <span class="reg">cruel</span> to its kind, as a <span class="reg">thief</span> and Murderer to his: It is  evident that such are in Africa, of <span class="reg">so</span> great <span class="reg">bigness</span> and plenty, that they  destroyed a great part of <span class="reg">Alexander's</span> army: Amongst the Asach√¶i a people  of <span class="reg">Ethiopia</span> are very great produced, which being <span class="reg">wrapped</span> together after  the manner of hurdles <span class="reg">do</span> with their heads lifted up make way to better  pasture. They report that the Kings of India <span class="reg">maintained</span> two Dragons, one
                         of eighty, and the other of ninety cubits in <span class="reg">bigness</span>: by the observation of
                         later writers and <span class="reg">nowadays</span> it is <span class="reg">known</span>, that near Angola are found such
                         as are <span class="reg">equal</span> to the great masts of ships: <span class="reg">So</span> they report that in some <span class="reg">certain</span> mountains of India and Africa there is great store of gold, but kept by
                         dragons, lest any one come thither and take it away: For dragons <span class="reg">do</span> resort  to fountains or rivers, which fall from the mountains, and <span class="reg">so</span> are <span class="reg">said</span> to watch
                         the gold by accident: for this reason <span class="reg">do</span> the Philosophers ascribe <span class="reg">so</span> many  dragons or serpents to their treasures, as to the golden Fleece, the garden of the  Hesperides, and to other persons or <span class="reg">Chymical</span> subjects, to Cadmus, Saturne, <span class="reg">Aesculapius</span>, Mercury, whose wand is begirt with two Serpents, male and female: but
                         <span class="reg">do</span> they <span class="reg">mean</span> nothing <span class="reg">else</span> by Dragons, but <span class="reg">Chymical</span> subjects? Hereupon  say they, the Dragons <span class="reg">yield</span> mountains, and the earth fountains to Rebis,  and denoting the extreme hunger of the dragon in devouring his <span class="reg">tail</span>: which
                         though others may interpret of the year returning into <span class="reg">itself</span>, and resembling
                         a circle, yet it was <span class="reg">accommodated</span> by the Philosophers to their things, who  by this dragon would have a Serpent understood, which <span class="reg">devours</span> another of
                         its <span class="reg">own</span> kind, and this is properly called Sulphur, as they all attest in innumerable places: Lully in his little <span class="reg">book</span> chapt. 31. This is, <span class="reg">says</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span>, Sulphur,
                         my <span class="reg">Son</span>! and this the Serpent and dragon devouring his <span class="reg">tail</span>, the roaring <span class="reg">lion</span>, and sharp sword, cutting, mortifying, and tearing all things. And
                         the Rosary: The Dragon <span class="reg">dies</span> not, <span class="reg">unless</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> be <span class="reg">killed</span> with his brother  and Sister. And a little after: The Dragon is Argent vive extracted from
                         <span class="reg">bodies</span>, having in it a body, <span class="reg">Soul</span>, and spirit: This is in the same place
                         called by another name <span class="reg">Fetid</span> water, which is produced after the separation
                         of the Elements: Now the Dragon is <span class="reg">said</span> to devour his <span class="reg">tail</span>, in consuming
                         the voluble, venomous, and moist part, that after without a <span class="reg">tail</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> may seem more corpulent and of <span class="reg">less</span> Speed, for the motion and volubility of him consisted <span class="reg">chiefly</span> in his <span class="reg">tail</span>: Other <span class="reg">animals</span> depend upon
                         feet, but dragons, Serpents, and <span class="reg">worms</span> of that kind <span class="reg">do</span> use constriction and
                         explication of body instead of feet, and as it were water poured out <span class="reg">do</span> divide into <span class="reg">certain</span> courses, inclining themselves sometimes this way sometimes that, as you may see in <span class="reg">almost</span> all rivers, how they <span class="reg">turn</span> their  courses like Serpents, and <span class="reg">run</span> obliquely in circuits: they did not therefore without reason call Argent vive a Serpent, and and add serpents to Mercury, it <span class="reg">also</span> drawing as it were a <span class="reg">tail</span>, and running sometimes this  sometimes that way with a voluble <span class="reg">poise</span>: For as a Serpent creeps <span class="reg">so</span> 
         <span class="reg">also</span> Mercury, who <span class="reg">has</span> therefore wings upon his feet and head. <span class="pb">49</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 14.</span> In <span class="reg">Africa</span> they say are flying Serpents, which would waste and depopulate all things, if they were not <span class="reg">destroyed</span> by the bird calld Ibis: For which
                         cause Ibis is erected amongst the sacred <span class="reg">Egyptian</span> images, both for the manifest utility, which it <span class="reg">performs</span> to the whole country, and for an occult  reason, which very few men have understood. This dragon biting of his  <span class="reg">tail</span>, and casting his old <span class="reg">skin</span> is <span class="reg">said</span> to acquire a new one together with
                         youth, as nature <span class="reg">has</span> granted longer life not <span class="reg">only</span> to Crows, Ravens, Eagles,
                         and Harts, but <span class="reg">also</span> to the Serpentine kind: The Ant growing old <span class="reg">acquires</span> wings, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> many <span class="reg">worms</span>: Man growing old is put into the earth, but
                         being revived from the earth will be consecrated to <span class="reg">eternal</span> life. Of every  Serpent burned is made a powder, which is taken safely against all <span class="reg">poisons</span> with great effect: Such an Alexipharmacum ought <span class="reg">also</span> to be made  of this dragon (who <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">already</span> devoured his <span class="reg">tail</span>, which is usually <span class="reg">cut</span> 
         <span class="reg">off</span> in Vipers) a most <span class="reg">effectual</span> remedy against the <span class="reg">adversities</span> of fortune and body . . . . . . . . . . . .</div>
