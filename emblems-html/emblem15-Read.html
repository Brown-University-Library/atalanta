      <div class="ab"> As this <span class="reg">orb</span> is by the <span class="reg">connection</span> of earth and water conglobated into one<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> round body, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> the Potters <span class="reg">work</span> seems to be compounded of the
                         same Elements particularly, namely of siccity and moisture, that one
                         may regulate the other: for if the earth should be without water, neither the Ocean, sea, lakes, rivers, or fountains would be near the earth,
                         it could bear nothing of <span class="reg">itself</span>, but <span class="reg">remain</span> barren: <span class="reg">So</span> if water should
                         not be received into the <span class="reg">cavities</span> of the earth, but stand about, it would
                         easily cover the whole earth, and <span class="reg">so</span> the same <span class="reg">remain</span> inhabitable:
                         but one <span class="reg">entering</span> amicably into the other, and water moderating the  siccity of the earth, the earth the moisture of that, by their <span class="reg">mutual</span> 
         <span class="reg">commixtion</span>, hereby is the fertility and utility of both Elements conspicuous: In like manner the Potter <span class="reg">mixes</span> clay with water, to make  thereof a tractable <span class="reg">mass</span>, which <span class="reg">he</span> Shapes by his <span class="reg">wheel</span>, and <span class="reg">sets</span> in
                         the warme <span class="reg">air</span>, that it may be gradually <span class="reg">dried</span>; then adds violence of  fire, that his <span class="reg">vessels</span> may be well hardened, and condensed into a durable
                         stone, which can resist both water and fire: <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> must <span class="reg">we</span> proceed
                         in the <span class="reg">natural</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span> as the Philosophers attest, and therefore <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">affirm</span> that example ought to be taken from the Potters. For as to siccity and  moisture, that is, earth and water, <span class="reg">we</span> doubt not that there is much  affinity in both, but much difference in the way of coction, and in the
                         matter and <span class="reg">form</span> of compounding the Elements: For Potters <span class="reg">vessels</span> have
                         an <span class="reg">artificial</span>
         <span class="reg">form</span>, the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> tincture a <span class="reg">form</span>
         <span class="reg">altogether</span>
         <span class="reg">natural</span>, and <span class="reg">so</span> much more noble than they, by how much the more excellent the matter of this is than theirs: either is indeed a <span class="reg">work</span> of earth, but
                         in the <span class="reg">Philsophical</span> there is nothing <span class="reg">said</span> to be, which <span class="reg">has</span> not ascended
                         and attained to the heaven of <span class="reg">air</span>, in that a <span class="reg">thick</span> and <span class="reg">feculent</span> earth is
                         <span class="reg">predominant</span>: The effect of both is a stone, there a <span class="reg">common</span>, here a <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>: by which name a <span class="reg">certain</span> person being seduced put a great  number of <span class="reg">artificial</span> stones or <span class="reg">tiles</span> into one chest, and the whiter sort
                         of flints into another, using <span class="reg">Diabolical</span> conjurations from above, by
                         which the last were at a <span class="reg">certain</span> time to be converted into silver, the
                         first into pure gold: but they being supposed to be the Philosophers
                         Stones, and therefore a great <span class="reg">sum</span> of <span class="reg">money</span>
         <span class="reg">accruing</span> to purchase <span class="reg">several</span> things, when the new gold and Silver might be expected, at a
                         <span class="reg">certain</span> time, in which it not appearing, nor the stones converted into
                         gold, as was desired, death put an end to the folly and Shame: For gold
                         or Silver ought not to be expected from that thing, in which it is not naturally, <span class="reg">diabolical</span>
         <span class="reg">Magic</span> having <span class="reg">no</span> place in these divine works, but
                         is as <span class="reg">far</span> different from them, as the author of it from a devout and  pious man, hell from heaven: <span class="reg">So</span> though it may be esteemed the true
                         <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> stone, yet let not any man <span class="reg">persuade</span>
         <span class="reg">himself</span>, that impossible things can performed by it, us <span class="reg">Isaac</span>
         <span class="reg">admonishes</span>: <span class="reg">no</span> man
                         being bound either by the <span class="reg">laws</span> of nature, or polity to things im
                        
                        
                        
                        <span class="pb">52</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 15.</span>possible: as for the transmutation of <span class="reg">gems</span> by it, and performing the  malleability of <span class="reg">glass</span> any man thereby perceive, whether these
                         things are possible, and <span class="reg">congruous</span> to this nature, or <span class="reg">no</span>: Geber affirms  that the Philosophers <span class="reg">speak</span> many things allegorically, as <span class="reg">also</span> of <span class="reg">himself</span>, that where <span class="reg">he</span> Spoke clearly and plainly, <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">said</span> nothing, but  where figuratively, there <span class="reg">he</span> absconded the truth, as wheat under  <span class="reg">chaff</span>: Those things which a man <span class="reg">sows</span>, the same <span class="reg">also</span> will <span class="reg">he</span> reap, which takes
                         place in vegetables and <span class="reg">animals</span>, though different Species may sometimes proceed
                         from the things sowed: whether these ought to be <span class="reg">applied</span> to <span class="reg">metals</span>,  which are not propagated by seed, as those, must be considered: In these the
                         parts <span class="reg">only</span> are homogeneous, Sulphur, and Argent vive, in those they are heterogeneous or <span class="reg">organic</span>: In these are <span class="reg">no</span> receptacles of seed, but in those:  In these there is not found any nutrition, augmentation, or extension in all
                         dimensions, in those very much: yea these are elemented weights admitting
                         mixtion alone, those <span class="reg">also</span> besides mixtion have either a vegetive or sensitive
                         <span class="reg">soul</span>: <span class="reg">Nevertheless</span> it is without doubt true that there is something in places
                         under the earth, which is not gold now, but will after a thousand years be  gold by nature: Who will deny this to be the <span class="reg">analogical</span> seed of gold? both  gold and the <span class="reg">aurific</span> nature being of one <span class="reg">original</span> and radix, though  this of the more noble <span class="reg">form</span>, and therefore the seed of gold being <span class="reg">known</span>,  this <span class="reg">also</span> will be manifested: The Philosophers <span class="reg">affirm</span> siccity and moisture or Sulphur and Argent vive to be that, which being most pure must
                         be extracted out of two mountains . . . . . . . . . . .</div>
