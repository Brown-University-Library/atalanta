                         Herman <span class="reg">Earl</span> of Henneberge, who, in the year 1276, brought forth
                         three hundred and sixty five children, which were all baptized,  and the males called by the name of John, and the females Elizabeth, their grave being dead is yet to be seen in the Church of Lausdune, one mile distant from the Hague towards the Sea in Holland,
                         together with the brazen bason, in which they were baptized, and an
                         inscription of the story: The cause <span class="reg">alleged</span> was, that the <span class="reg">Countess</span>,
                         <span class="reg">seeing</span> a poor woman carry two children <span class="reg">twins</span> in her <span class="reg">arms</span>, <span class="reg">called</span> her
                         <span class="reg">adulteress</span>, as if it was impossible for more children to be <span class="reg">born</span> at one
                         conception by one man, but necessarily by <span class="reg">several</span>: Whereupon an imprecation being made by the poor woman, who knew her <span class="reg">self</span> clear  of that accusation, the <span class="reg">Countess</span> conceived in her <span class="reg">womb</span> at one time
                         and by one man <span class="reg">so</span> many children, as there are <span class="reg">days</span> in the year:
                         This is indeed a miracle, but a <span class="reg">natural</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span>, which happened  through the vengeance of God: But in the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span> that, which is otherwise contrary to nature, is easily admitted under
                         the <span class="reg">veil</span> of an allegory: For here one infant is <span class="reg">said</span> to have three fathers, or <span class="reg">also</span> two, as <span class="reg">also</span> mothers: Hereupon <span class="reg">says</span> Raymund cited by the  Rosary; Our infant <span class="reg">has</span> two fathers and two mothers, and because <span class="reg">he</span> with his whole substance is tenderly nourished in fire, <span class="reg">he</span> therefore  never <span class="reg">dies</span>: <span class="reg">So</span> Dionysus or Bacchus is <span class="reg">said</span> to have two mothers, who  was <span class="reg">ripped</span> out of his mothers belly (being burned) before the time of his
                         maturity, and matured in his fathers thigh, <span class="reg">so</span> that the father became
                         a mother: But these things are better declared in the conception of  Orion, who is <span class="reg">said</span> to be produced from the seed of Apollo, Vulcan,  and Mercury <span class="reg">mixed</span> together, and <span class="reg">preserved</span> in the hide of an <span class="reg">Ox</span> for
                         the space of <span class="reg">ten</span>

Lully in the <span class="reg">Theoric</span> of his Testament attributes to the same <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> infant <span class="reg">so</span> many and <span class="reg">almost</span> the same fathers, namely Sol, who
                         is Apollo, or the <span class="reg">celestial</span> Sol is the first author of this generation,  who by his ineffable virtue occult or <span class="reg">astral</span> power operates upon a  <span class="reg">certain</span> matter <span class="reg">known</span> to the Philosophers, as upon the matrix <span class="pb">154</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 49.</span> of a woman, and therein <span class="reg">produces</span> a <span class="reg">Son</span> or infant like to <span class="reg">himself</span>,
                         to <span class="reg">whom</span> afterwards <span class="reg">he</span> will leave and <span class="reg">resign</span> his <span class="reg">arms</span> and ensigns  of virtues, by <span class="reg">paternal</span> right, that is, the faculty of maturing things immature, and the energy of tinging and purging things not tinged nor
                         purged. For whatsoever Sol is able to perfect in a thousand years, that
                         will his <span class="reg">Son</span>
         <span class="reg">perform</span> in <span class="reg">half</span> an <span class="reg">hour</span>; That therefore virtue  may be made a thousand times stronger in him, than in Sol, his father delivers him to Vulcan and the Artist together for education, that  his generous disposition may be polished and <span class="reg">multiplied</span> in virtues by
                         their means; for manifest it is that to practice from a child <span class="reg">conduces</span> much: <span class="reg">So</span> Achilles, Jason, Hercules were <span class="reg">committed</span> to Chiron to be instructed for the same end. For Milo the Crotonian, who being a boy  <span class="reg">carried</span> a <span class="reg">calf</span>, when a man <span class="reg">carried</span> an <span class="reg">Ox</span> by <span class="reg">custom</span>. Besides Sol,
                         Vulcan and the artist are not <span class="reg">erroneously</span> reputed the fathers of this
                         child, because as <span class="reg">he</span> was the first, they made him to be such and <span class="reg">so</span> great: <span class="reg">No</span>
         <span class="reg">equivalent</span> compensation can be made to Masters for institution, as neither reward to parents for generation. These compose
                         the body, those the mind. If the mind be better than the body, <span class="reg">no</span> 
         <span class="reg">less</span>
         <span class="reg">recompense</span> is due to those, than to these. In the production of  Orion Mercury contributed matter, Apollo <span class="reg">form</span>, and Vulcan heat, or
                         the <span class="reg">external</span> efficient cause: <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> in the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span> it is proper for three fathers to be seen to have conspired for the procreation of one infant, in <span class="reg">whom</span> the Philosophers take great delight.
