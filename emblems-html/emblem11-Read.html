         <span class="reg">So</span> great is the diversity of Authors in writing, that the explorators of  truth <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">almost</span>
         <span class="reg">despair</span> of finding the end of art: <span class="milestone">e11-02</span>for <span class="reg">Allegorical</span> speeches
                         being of themselves difficult to be understood, and the causes of many errors,
                         especially then, if the same words be <span class="reg">applied</span> to different things, and different words to the same things: <span class="milestone">e11-03</span>out of which if a man would extricate <span class="reg">himself</span>, <span class="reg">he</span> must either be of a divine genius, to perceive the truth involved in <span class="reg">so</span> great <span class="reg">darkness</span>, or of <span class="reg">endless</span> pains and charge in proving what
                         is true, what not: <span class="milestone">e11-04</span>But the Philosophers say one is not sufficient  without the  other, an acute genius without <span class="reg">handlabor</span>, or this without that, as neither
                         the theory without the practice, and contrarywise: <span class="milestone">e11-05</span>for <span class="reg">no</span> man is of <span class="reg">so</span> discreet an understanding as to <span class="reg">avoid</span> a hundred thousand circumvagations,
                         errors, <span class="reg">falsities</span> as to the word, digressions, and <span class="reg">ambiguities</span>, and persist in the
                         true path of nature: wherefore say the Philosophers, <span class="reg">he</span> that <span class="reg">has</span> not as
                         yet erred, <span class="reg">has</span> not yet begun, and that errors are the informers of those  things which ought to be done or not. <span class="milestone">e11-06</span>
         <span class="reg">So</span> the same <span class="reg">do</span> inculcate, that a  man may spend his whole life, though <span class="reg">he</span> Should live a thousand years, in
                         distilling and redistilling, before <span class="reg">he</span> can <span class="reg">attain</span> to truth by experimentation
                         alone: <span class="milestone">e11-07</span>That little benefit can be had without study and reading of authors, the Corrector of fools <span class="reg">signifies</span>, saying: Study <span class="reg">removes</span> ignorance,  and <span class="reg">reduces</span> a mans genius to true understanding, and the knowledge of
                         every thing: It is therefore principally necessary to acquire the knowledge of
                         this delectable <span class="reg">work</span> by study, and to sharpen the <span class="reg">wit</span> by <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> sayings, the knowledge of truth being <span class="reg">centered</span> in them: <span class="milestone">e11-08</span>If therefore operators despise not study, they will sweetly relish the fruit from thence <span class="reg">proceeding</span>: <span class="milestone">e11-09</span>but they that <span class="reg">abhor</span> study, and yet are willing to operate, let them
                         see whether that art be the imitation of nature <span class="reg">herself</span>, which the art of
                         her desires to amend: because it is impossible for it to <span class="reg">prepare</span> the Philosophers secrets to a perfect end: <span class="milestone">e11-10</span>Of these men say the Sophi, that they <span class="reg">run</span> to
                         practice as an <span class="reg">ass</span> to hay, not knowing what to lay his nose to, <span class="reg">only</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> far
                         as the outward senses <span class="reg">do</span> without understanding lead him to food by sight
                         and <span class="reg">taste</span>: these are his words. <span class="milestone">e11-11</span>But lest a man should macerate <span class="reg">himself</span> with
                         overmuch study, which is an inexhaustible sea and of immense profundity
                         and <span class="reg">endeavor</span> (though in <span class="reg">vain</span>) to bring every letter, agreeing <span class="reg">also</span> with many other things, into act, in the <span class="reg">mean</span> time consuming or diminishing his
                         strength, time, reputation, wealth and riches, the Philosophers <span class="reg">do</span> use this

         <div class="margin-note">
            <span class="note-mark">*</span>!</div> of the <span class="underline">twelve</span> divine <span class="reg">Hieroglyphics</span> of the <span class="reg">Egyptians</span>, by <span class="reg">whom</span> these  and other <span class="reg">Allegories</span> were propagated amongst other nations, very few of  the <span class="reg">Egyptians</span>
         <span class="reg">Priests</span>, and those <span class="reg">only</span> understanding the true meaning  and sense of them, all the rest referring them to other subjects, which were  not in the nature of things, namely various Gods, Goddesses, and the like:  <span class="milestone">e11-16</span>Hereupon Latona had there the most sumptuous temple next to Vulcan, covered and adorned with gold, as <span class="reg">She</span> that was the Mother of the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> Apollo and Diana: <span class="milestone">e11-17</span>but this Latona is <span class="reg">brown</span> and blackish, and <span class="reg">has</span> many
                         moles and blemishes in her face, which must be taken away by art, namely
                         by dealbation: <span class="milestone">e11-18</span>Some <span class="reg">do</span> make dealbations of Ceruse, Mercury Sublimate,
                         <span class="reg">Talc</span>, reduced into <span class="reg">oil</span>, and the like, with which they incrust, cover, and
                         <span class="reg">so</span> whiten the outside of the <span class="reg">Skin</span>; but these whitening incrustations
                         fall <span class="reg">off</span> with every wind or liquor, because they <span class="reg">do</span> not penetrate to the more
                         inward parts: <span class="milestone">e11-19</span>But the Philosophers care not for such colorations, which are  <span class="reg">used</span> more to deceive the eyes, than to tinge the <span class="reg">internal</span> substance of the
                         body: For they would have the face of Latona whitened thoroughly, and
                         the <span class="reg">Skin</span>
         <span class="reg">itself</span> altered, that is, <span class="reg">truly</span>, and not superficially: <span class="milestone">e11-20</span>a <span class="reg">Question</span> might be asked how it can be? I answer, Latona must be first sought out
                         and <span class="reg">known</span>, which though <span class="reg">She</span> be taken out of a vile place, must notwithstanding be sublimed to a more worthy, but if <span class="reg">She</span> be taken out
                         of a more worthy place, <span class="reg">She</span> must be <span class="reg">thrown</span> into a place more vile,  namely into dung: for there will <span class="reg">She</span> become truely white, and be  made white lead, which being had, there is <span class="reg">no</span> need to doubt of <span class="reg">success</span>, or red lead, which is the <span class="reg">beginning</span> and end of the <span class="reg">work</span>. . .</div>
