      <div class="ab"> The common token and <span class="reg">symbol</span>, by which the Philosophers know one another,<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> is, that nature is guided, taught, governed, subdued and overcome by nature, as
                         a young <span class="reg">Scholar</span> by a <span class="reg">Mistress</span>, a waiting <span class="reg">maid</span> by her Lady, a subject by a
                         Queen, yea a daughter by the mother, and kinswoman by kinswoman: how  true it is, appears by <span class="reg">daily</span> experience, in the education of youth amongst  men, and other actions, as literary discipline or institution, government, and
                         the like. Pliny writes of the <span class="reg">Nightingale</span>, that one <span class="reg">teaches</span>, attends, observes,  imitates, overcomes another in singing, or being overcome <span class="reg">grieves</span>, and that  sometimes being outdone and vanquished in the conflict, the throat being broken,
                         it <span class="reg">perishes</span>, and in the <span class="reg">middle</span> of singing falls <span class="reg">down</span> dead: <span class="reg">We</span> see <span class="reg">also</span> how
                         all sorts of birds <span class="reg">do</span> begin to <span class="reg">accustom</span> and instruct their young being yet
                         unfeathered and tender for flying, that not <span class="reg">only</span> nature, but <span class="reg">also</span> art or  use <span class="reg">has</span> begotten in them the habit of flying, though nature alone gave  power and organs to exercise that action, without which neither institution
                         or art can find foundation or place: <span class="reg">so</span> colts are taught to <span class="reg">run</span> by the  mare, whelps to <span class="reg">bark</span> by the bitch, and young foxes to craft by the
                         dam, nor is there any animated and sensitive nature or species of nature found, which guides, instructs, and governs not another nature, as its
                         minor, or suffers <span class="reg">itself</span> to be overcome by another, as a Parent: <span class="reg">We</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> not perceive such discipline in vegetables, yet notwithstanding the use is
                         observed in them, and that mens hands are of much efficacy: for whilst  <span class="reg">corn</span> is in the blade, it may be cleansed from incommodious thistles and
                         tares, whilst a tree is yet a twig it may be bent, and made to grow as  you please: <span class="reg">So</span> in <span class="reg">metals</span> and <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> subjects one nature keeps,
                         <span class="reg">preserves</span>, and defends another nature in fire, as is <span class="reg">known</span> to founders and
                         testers, but especially to the masters of <span class="reg">natural</span> things: Iron is very <span class="reg">helpful</span> and as a midwife to Silver and gold being yet very tender and <span class="reg">Spiritual</span>,
                         as they call it, <span class="reg">mixed</span> in its <span class="reg">mines</span> with Cadmia, <span class="reg">Arsenic</span>, or Antimony
                         the <span class="reg">chief</span>, if it be cast into <span class="reg">mines</span> to be <span class="reg">burned</span> in a fire of furnaces:  after the same manner iron <span class="reg">itself</span>, if it be intended to be changed into
                         <span class="reg">Steel</span>, is saved from burning by white stones found at the Sea <span class="reg">Shores</span>;
                         Some <span class="reg">do</span> cast the powders of <span class="reg">crystal</span>
         <span class="reg">glass</span>, or the gall of <span class="reg">glass</span> upon
                         <span class="reg">metallic</span> powders which are to be dissolved, that they may not perish by over much fire: Instead of this gall of <span class="reg">glass</span> the Philosophers
                         <span class="reg">do</span> use their Eudica, which Morienus <span class="reg">says</span> is <span class="reg">also</span> the gall of <span class="reg">glass</span>,  and to be had in <span class="reg">glass</span>
         <span class="reg">vessels</span>: for the heat of fire consumes the body
                         with hasty burning: but Eudica <span class="reg">applied</span> will free <span class="reg">bodies</span> changed into
                         earth from any burning: For <span class="reg">bodies</span>, when now they <span class="reg">do</span> not <span class="reg">retain</span> their <span class="reg">souls</span>, are soon burned: Eudica (the <span class="reg">feces</span> of <span class="reg">glass</span>) is indeed very
                         <span class="reg">agreeable</span> to all <span class="reg">bodies</span>, for it <span class="reg">vivifies</span> and <span class="reg">prepares</span> them, and defends
                         them from all burning: These are the sayings of Morienus the Roman:
                         This therefore is the nature, which <span class="reg">teaches</span> another nature to resist  fire, and be <span class="reg">inured</span> to it, which is the <span class="reg">Mistress</span> instructing the <span class="pb">67</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 20.</span> young <span class="reg">Scholar</span>, and if you consider well, which is the Queen governing  the subject, and which is the daughter nobilitating and dignifying the mother;
                         This is that red servant, which is <span class="reg">joined</span> in matrimony with his odoriferous
                         mother, and of her begets a progeny <span class="reg">far</span> more noble than the parents  thereof: This is Pyrrhus the <span class="reg">Son</span> of Achilles, and the young man with
                         red <span class="reg">hair</span>, golden vestment, <span class="reg">black</span> eyes, white feet: This is the knight  with a collar or <span class="reg">chain</span> armed with sword and buckler against the Dragon, to rescue out of his <span class="reg">jaws</span> the pure and unviolated virgin Albifica,  <span class="reg">surnamed</span> Beja, or Blanca: This is the monsterkilling Hercules, who  delivered from the monster Hesione the daughter of Laomedon being  exposed to a <span class="reg">terrible</span> and <span class="reg">cruel</span> Whale: This is that Perseus, who defended (released, and <span class="reg">married</span>) Andromeda, the daughter of Cassiope
                         and Cepheus King of <span class="reg">Ethiopia</span>, from the Sea monster, <span class="reg">Showing</span> the  head of Medusa: This is <span class="reg">he</span> that may be compared with those ancient Romans the <span class="reg">preservers</span> and refiners of the people, Marcus Curtius, Lucius Sc√¶vola, Horatius Cocles, Manlius Capitolinus, and the like, to rescue the
                         <span class="reg">City</span>, as it were the mother, from dangers: For this is the way and <span class="reg">form</span> of nature tending to the perfection of any <span class="reg">work</span>, to bring one thing out
                         of another, a thing more perfect out of a thing imperfect, and reduce
                         power into action, but not perfect all things in a moment, but one thing
                         after another: Nor this alone, but <span class="reg">she</span> constitutes <span class="reg">also</span> her deputy in the
                         first place, to which <span class="reg">She</span> leaves the power of life and death, that is, of
                         forming other things, as for example, in the generation of man <span class="reg">She</span> 
         <span class="reg">uses</span> a long <span class="reg">processes</span>, as of <span class="reg">ten</span>
         <span class="reg">months</span>, where first attending to the
                         opinion of Aristotle, <span class="reg">She</span> fabricates the heart, as the vicar, deputy, or
                         <span class="reg">principal</span>
         <span class="reg">bowel</span>, and then the heart delineates, <span class="reg">forms</span>, and perfects
                         the other parts necessary to nutrition, the life, senses, and generative
                         power, and <span class="reg">communicates</span> to them life and <span class="reg">vivific</span> spirits by Systole  and diastole, or dilatation and compression of the <span class="reg">arteries</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> long  as it is not impeded by diseases and violence: And thus one nature  <span class="reg">teaches</span> another, which you must observe and follow for an example
                         of the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span>, as a thing most clear and evident . . .</div>
