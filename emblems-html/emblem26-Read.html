         <span class="milestone">e26-01</span>Tully <span class="reg">has</span> excellently described the <span class="reg">essential</span> difference of man, whereby <span class="reg">he</span> differs from all other <span class="reg">animals</span>, after this manner: As a bird is intended by nature
                         for flying, a horse for <span class="subst">
            <span class="del">reasoning</span>
            <span class="add">running</span>
         </span>, <span class="reg">so</span> man for reasoning: <span class="milestone">e26-02</span>For as <span class="reg">Lions</span>, bears,  and <span class="reg">Tigers</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> exercise and delight themselves in <span class="reg">fierceness</span>, Elephants and
                         bulls in strength of body, Eagles, Falcons, and other <span class="reg">hawks</span> in the prey of birds,
                         and <span class="reg">swiftness</span> of wings; <span class="reg">so</span> man <span class="reg">excels</span> those and all others in reason,  discourse of mind and understanding: <span class="milestone">e26-03</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> that there is <span class="reg">no</span>
         <span class="reg">fierceness</span>, <span class="reg">no</span> 
         <span class="reg">corporal</span> strength, <span class="reg">no</span> celerity, or such like things in beasts <span class="reg">so</span> great, as not
                         to be mitigated, subdued, and prevented by reason alone: For reason is not
                         a thing <span class="reg">human</span>, or <span class="reg">proceeding</span> from the earth, but as the Poet <span class="reg">says</span>, a particle of divine breath, sent from heaven into the body of man: <span class="milestone">e26-04</span>but it is sometimes called memory, sometimes the <span class="reg">intellectual</span> virtue, to which if use or  experience be added, <span class="reg">wisdom</span> Springs from thence, which is most <span class="reg">precious</span> to man: For use is reported to be as the father, and reason or memory as the
                         mother of <span class="reg">so</span> generous an offspring: From whence that <span class="reg">common</span> saying: Use  begat <span class="reg">me</span>, and my mother memory brought <span class="reg">me</span> forth: <span class="milestone">e26-05</span>but the <span class="reg">question</span> is,
                         what is true <span class="reg">wisdom</span>, and most worthy of mans inquisition, there being infinite opinions concerning it, every man interpreting it according to his <span class="reg">own</span> imagination? <span class="milestone">e26-06</span>It may be answered, that <span class="reg">wisdom</span> in <span class="reg">human</span> things (<span class="reg">always</span> to be
                         excepted in divine things relating to the <span class="reg">welfare</span> of the <span class="reg">Soul</span>) consists not
                         in <span class="reg">sophistical</span> arguments, not in <span class="reg">rhetorical</span> and garnished discoures, not  in the <span class="reg">poetical</span> sounds of verses, not in the <span class="reg">critical</span>
         <span class="reg">subtleties</span> of <span class="reg">Grammarians</span>, not in <span class="reg">willfullness</span> and obstinacy, in <span class="reg">deceits</span> and <span class="reg">perjuries</span>, in <span class="reg">equivocations</span> and <span class="reg">lies</span>, in oppression and sweat of the poor, the craft of heaping up
                         wealth and riches, nor in any thing <span class="reg">else</span>, but the true knowledge of Chymistry,
                         together with practice, most <span class="reg">commodious</span> to mankind: <span class="milestone">e26-07</span>This is <span class="reg">wisdom</span> surpassing
                         all things, which on the right hand goes to the East, on the left to the west,  and comprehends the whole earth: <span class="milestone">e26-08</span>

In the treasures of <span class="reg">wisdom</span> is understanding and holy knowledge, and <span class="reg">elsewhere</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> calls it the discipline of
                         sense, or doctrine of the understanding: <span class="milestone">e26-15</span>Concerning this <span class="reg">says</span> Morienus the Philosopher: This knowledge is that which <span class="reg">draws</span> its owner from the misery of this
                         world, and brings him to the knowledge of good things to come: <span class="milestone">e26-16</span>And that it
                         is the gift of God <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">himself</span>
         <span class="reg">affirms</span> in these words: God <span class="reg">confers</span> this  divine and pure knowledge upon his <span class="reg">faithful</span> servants, that is to say, those  <span class="reg">whom</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> determined from the primitive nature of things to <span class="reg">confer</span> it  upon through his <span class="reg">wonderful</span> generosity: <span class="milestone">e26-17</span>And a little after: For this can be
                         nothing <span class="reg">else</span> but the <span class="reg">gift</span> of the most high God, who <span class="reg">commits</span> and reveals it
                         as <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">pleases</span>, and <span class="reg">also</span> to which of his <span class="reg">faithful</span> servants <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">pleases</span>,  they therefore ought to be humble and <span class="reg">altogether</span> subject in all things  to the omnipotent God: <span class="milestone">e26-18</span>And after: It is convenient <span class="reg">also</span> for you, O King, to  know that this Magistery is nothing <span class="reg">else</span> but the most high and great Gods
                         arcanum and secret of secrets, for this secret <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">committed</span> to his Prophets,
                         whose <span class="reg">souls</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span> placed in his Paradise: <span class="milestone">e26-19</span>It is <span class="reg">also</span> called the tree of
                         life, not that is <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">eternal</span> life in it, but <span class="reg">shows</span> as it were the way to it,
                         and bears fruit wholesome for this life, which it cannot be without, such
                         as are health, the good things of fortune and mind: for without these a  man even living is dead, and not much unlike to a brute, though outwardly <span class="reg">he</span> represent him that <span class="reg">he</span> ought to be, and is not in his better  <span class="reg">part</span>. . . . . . . . . . . . .</div>
