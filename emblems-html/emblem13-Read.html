                         The Philosophers <span class="reg">brass</span> is <span class="reg">hydropical</span>, and desires to be seven
                         times <span class="reg">washed</span> in a river, as Naaman the leper in <span class="reg">Jordan</span>.</h3>

         <br/>Humors <span class="reg">Hydropical</span> the Sophian <span class="reg">brass</span>
         <br/>Infesting, has <span class="reg">no</span> cure but one alas:<br/>Naaman the leper did <span class="reg">himself</span> restore,<br/>Bathing his limbs in Jordan <span class="reg">over</span> and <span class="reg">over</span>;<br/>
         <span class="reg">So</span> if your <span class="reg">brass</span> be <span class="reg">washed</span> in water pure,<br/>Its <span class="reg">present</span>, Hydropsy will not endure.</div>

      <div class="ab"> That Naaman the Syrian <span class="reg">betook</span>
         <span class="reg">himself</span> to <span class="reg">Judea</span> at the <span class="reg">persuasion</span> of the<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> Prophet, and <span class="reg">washed</span>
         <span class="reg">himself</span> seven times in the river Jordan, is to be <span class="reg">ascribed</span> to his confidence in the Prophets words, but that <span class="reg">he</span> was freed from the Leprosy by that washing, is a miracle of divine omnipotence: For the Leprosy,
                         which being seated in the blood, and <span class="reg">radical</span> parts of mans body, is as it were
                         an <span class="reg">universal</span> Canker, cannot be cured or taken away by any <span class="reg">external</span> washings, much <span class="reg">less</span> of cold water, such as was of Jordan. After the same  manner that the Philosophers <span class="reg">brass</span> diseased with an Hydropsy, Should be
                         freed from it by the washings of water, yea that being imperfect it Should be
                         reduced to perfection, and being <span class="reg">sick</span> to health, <span class="reg">so</span> as to be able to <span class="reg">communicate</span> the same to other <span class="reg">sick</span>
         <span class="reg">bodies</span>, is next to a miracle: For such an example is
                         not <span class="reg">elsewhere</span> extant in nature, nor is it the ordinary way of nature to produce the Philosophers most absolute tincture, <span class="reg">unless</span> it be governed by art,  and <span class="reg">fit</span> subjects <span class="reg">administered</span> to it with the <span class="reg">external</span> efficient. <span class="reg">So</span> the restitution of luxations or dislocations is not peculiar to nature, but art: <span class="reg">Nevertheless</span> the Os Sacrum opens <span class="reg">itself</span> miraculously in the birth of a child, that  the infant may thereby have <span class="reg">egress</span>, as by a door, and herein the most great
                         and <span class="reg">merciful</span> God operates by nature above nature: <span class="reg">So</span> that the Stone  should be perfected, may <span class="reg">seem</span> to be a thing <span class="reg">supernatural</span>, though really
                         it is <span class="reg">natural</span>: Wherefore <span class="reg">says</span> a Philosopher in the Rosary, You must know  that our stone is airy and volatile, externally cold and moist, internally  <span class="reg">hot</span> and dry: and that <span class="reg">coldness</span> and moisture which is <span class="reg">external</span>, is a <span class="reg">watery</span> fume, corrupting, blacking, and destroying <span class="reg">itself</span> and all things, and <span class="reg">flies</span> from fire: and that heat and siccity which is <span class="reg">internal</span>, is gold <span class="reg">hot</span> and dry,
                         and is a most pure <span class="reg">oil</span>, penetrating <span class="reg">bodies</span>, and is not fugitive, because the
                         heat and siccity of <span class="reg">Alchemy</span>
         <span class="reg">tinges</span>, and nothing <span class="reg">else</span>: Cause therefore the
                         <span class="reg">external</span>
         <span class="reg">coldness</span> and <span class="reg">watery</span> moisture, to be like to the <span class="reg">internal</span> heat and
                         siccity, <span class="reg">so</span> that they may agree and be united together, and all at once bemade one penetrating, tinging, and fixing body: but these moistures must be
                         <span class="reg">destroyed</span> by fire, and degrees of fire with soft temperament, and a congruous
                         and moderate digestion: These there: But if true, how can it be freed from  water by water? but it may be answered, that some <span class="reg">certain</span> waters are  <span class="reg">hot</span> and dry in quality, such as are many baths, in which it must be Philosophically washed: For this is that which they say, wash with fire, and  <span class="reg">burn</span> with water; for that fire, which <span class="reg">washes</span>, and that water, which <span class="reg">burns</span>, differ one from the other in name <span class="reg">only</span>, but agree in effect and operation: That <span class="reg">brass</span> therefore must be <span class="reg">washed</span>, that is, <span class="reg">dried</span> from its superfluous moistures by this water, or this fire: <span class="reg">We</span> have <span class="reg">known</span> experiments  of <span class="reg">Hydropical</span>
         <span class="reg">bodies</span> cured by six <span class="reg">months</span> abstinence from any <span class="reg">drink</span>,  by being <span class="reg">buried</span> in <span class="underline">
            <span class="reg">hot</span> sand</span>, or <span class="underline">
            <span class="reg">Cows</span> dung, </span>by being put in a ho<span class="underline">
            <span class="reg">t</span> fur</span>
         <span class="underline">nace, and sweating, and innu</span>merable other helps, yea <span class="reg">also</span> b<span class="underline">y drying</span> 
         <span class="underline">baths, such as are at Carolina and Wisbadenses not <span class="reg">far</span>
         </span> from Mentz:
                         By the same <span class="reg">ways</span> must this Patient be cured, sometimes by waters, <span class="pb">46</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 13.</span> sometimes by the <span class="reg">hot</span>
         <span class="reg">air</span> of furnaces, sometimes by dung, sometimes Sand,<span class="note-mark">*</span>
         <div class="margin-note">
            <span class="note-mark">*</span>NB</div> and by abstaining from <span class="reg">drink</span>: for these are most <span class="reg">effectual</span>
         <span class="reg">remedies</span> in both
                         cases, here and there to be used: but in all these things heat is the operator,  which <span class="reg">draws</span> forth and consumes the superfluous water by the <span class="reg">Emunctories</span> or <span class="reg">also</span> pores of the body: For <span class="reg">external</span> heat quickens the <span class="reg">internal</span>, that is,
                         the <span class="reg">vital</span> Spirits, to <span class="reg">expel</span> that moisture which is noxious to it, as an unprofitable excrement, by which the <span class="reg">natural</span> heat was before <span class="reg">suppressed</span> as by  an enemy: In this cure there is need of great diligence and <span class="reg">precaution</span>,  lest whilst one <span class="reg">bowel</span> is <span class="reg">helped</span>, another be hurt: In a Quartan (the <span class="reg">Platonic</span> probation of a <span class="reg">Physician</span>) <span class="reg">we</span> find, that <span class="reg">thick</span> and viscous humors,
                         like the <span class="reg">gum</span> or <span class="reg">glue</span> of trees, being gathered together from all the veins  and <span class="reg">mass</span> of blood, <span class="reg">do</span> descend through the hollow or great <span class="reg">vein</span> even to the
                         <span class="reg">bottom</span> of the <span class="reg">back</span>, where obstructing the emulgent veins, which draw
                         the serous humor out of the blood, or the passages of them, they are <span class="reg">less</span> able to operate, and more serous liquor <span class="reg">remains</span> in the body, and <span class="reg">so</span> in
                         a short time, if care be not taken, a Dropsy may happen, the other <span class="reg">bowels</span> being <span class="reg">also</span> untainted at first: <span class="reg">Diuretics</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> here little or <span class="reg">no</span> good, purgatives
                         yet <span class="reg">less</span>, <span class="reg">unless</span> diminution and eduction be made in some <span class="reg">certain</span> series of  time: <span class="reg">Sudorifics</span> are <span class="reg">also</span> manifestly <span class="reg">hurtful</span>, because they draw out the more  <span class="reg">subtle</span> parts, leaving the thicker, and being continued debilitate the body: for  the <span class="reg">custom</span> of nature is to find that way to evacuate <span class="reg">serosities</span> through the pores
                         when <span class="reg">she</span> is obstructed about the bladder: This therefore is Scylla, the other  Charybdis, both which <span class="reg">he</span> that has a mind to <span class="reg">preserve</span>
         <span class="reg">himself</span> ought to  <span class="reg">avoid</span>: But that Dropsy which proceeds from an impaired Liver or Spleen,  if it be confirmed, is of most difficult cure: Now in the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> 
         <span class="reg">brass</span> the cure is not impossible, the distemper being rather by accident,  and <span class="reg">secondary</span>, than <span class="reg">essential</span> or primary, provided it be cautiously begun, as <span class="reg">we</span> have <span class="reg">said</span> concerning the plenty of serum in a Quartan, to  <span class="reg">wit</span>, that it may not by overmuch <span class="reg">exsiccation</span> fall into a consumption, or
                         by humectation into a Dropsy difficult to be cured . . . . . .</div>
