      <div class="ab"> All men, that have but once heard the name and power of the Stone,<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> 
         <span class="reg">unless</span> they be such as are <span class="reg">altogether</span> incredulous, <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">commonly</span>
         <span class="reg">ask</span> where it is to be found, that they may <span class="reg">run</span> as it were by a straight line
                         to it? The Philosophers answer in two places: first, that Adam brought it
                         with him out of Paradise, that it is in you, in <span class="reg">me</span>, and in every man,  that birds flying carry it with them out of <span class="reg">far</span>
         <span class="reg">countries</span>: Secondly
                         that it may be found in the earth, mountains, <span class="reg">air</span>, and water. Which
                         therefore must <span class="reg">we</span> adhere to, whether to this, or that? To both, in my  opinion, but in a peculiar respect, though the last is more plausible, and
                         seems to us more safe. It is <span class="reg">said</span> to be throwne upon the earth, because
                         the Element of earth <span class="reg">does</span> first appear in a <span class="reg">dark</span> and <span class="reg">black</span> body: Secondly, because it is a thing of <span class="reg">mean</span> and small <span class="reg">esteem</span>, which is trodden
                         upon in the <span class="reg">ways</span> of travellers, and in dung <span class="reg">itself</span>; Whereupon <span class="reg">says</span> Rosarius, if I should name it, <span class="reg">fools</span> would not <span class="reg">believe</span> that to be it: And
                         Calis sifting Morienus, and trying to get much out of him, <span class="reg">he</span> answers  him thus: This, as a wise man <span class="reg">says</span>, <span class="reg">has</span> both the rich and the <span class="reg">poor</span>,  both the <span class="reg">liberal</span> and the covetous, going <span class="reg">also</span> and sitting. For it is <span class="reg">thrown</span> in the <span class="reg">ways</span>, and trampled upon in dunghills, and many men have <span class="reg">already</span>
         <span class="reg">digged</span> in dunghills for it, and herein have been deceived. Mundus <span class="reg">also</span> in Turba <span class="reg">says</span>, if the Sellers knew it, they would not sell it at <span class="reg">so</span> mean a rate. And Arnold affirms, that the stone may be had gratis,  as much as a man will, and for that reason <span class="reg">no</span> man ought to be interrogated. All which things are true. For who, but an <span class="reg">inhuman</span> wretch,  will deny water and earth to him that desires it? The most ancient
                         Cimbri having desired and not able to <span class="reg">obtain</span> the same <span class="reg">gifts</span> from  the Romans, <span class="reg">entering</span> Italy with a great army slew many thousands
                         of the Romans with their Consuls, as <span class="reg">histories</span> declare. For earth, as
                         the mother of all things, is most <span class="reg">precious</span>, as the last matter of things
                         <span class="reg">putrified</span>, most despicable; <span class="reg">No</span> thing more vile than clay or dirt,  which notwithstanding is nothing <span class="reg">else</span>, but earth <span class="reg">mixed</span> with water.  What more <span class="reg">common</span> than a <span class="reg">clod</span> of earth? Yet Euripylus the <span class="reg">Son</span> of Neptune <span class="reg">offered</span> it as a present to the <span class="reg">heroic</span> Argonauts, by  which not refused, but thankfully accepted, afterwards being dissolved in water Medea divined many things. For earth must be
                         dissolvd in water, otherwise neither this, nor that <span class="reg">avails</span> any thing:
                         After this manner is the Stone cast upon the earth, in which notwithstanding it <span class="reg">does</span> not continue abject and contemptible, but is
                         exalted to the mountains, as the flammivomous Athos, Vesuvius,  <span class="reg">Aetna</span>, and the like, whereof many such are seen in <span class="reg">diverse</span> parts  of the world: For a <span class="reg">perpetual</span> fire <span class="reg">burns</span> in them, which <span class="reg">sublimes</span> the Stone, and <span class="reg">raises</span> it to the highest dignity. As in
                        
                        
                        <span class="pb">115</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 36.</span> mountains it <span class="reg">grows</span> in a rude <span class="reg">form</span> out of Sulphur and Argent vive, <span class="reg">so</span> is it matured and perfected at the top of the mountains, where <span class="reg">also</span> is an <span class="reg">herb</span> produced, without which fire cannot be regulated, because
                         being cold and moist if it be cast into fire, the vehemency of it is retunded by its contrary: From the mountains it <span class="reg">passes</span> to the <span class="reg">air</span>,  where it finds habitation. For the <span class="reg">air</span> becomes a house to it, wherein it
                         is enclosed, which is nothing <span class="reg">else</span>, but to be <span class="reg">carried</span> in the belly of  wind, and <span class="reg">born</span> in the <span class="reg">air</span>, of which terms <span class="reg">we</span> have spoken before.
                         At length it is nourished in rivers, that is, Mercury in waters: For that  reason the Athenians in <span class="reg">honor</span> thereof instituted their <span class="reg">Hydrophories</span>, because the matter of the Philosophers stone is water, as Rosarius <span class="reg">says</span>, and
                         is understood of the water of those three. For which reason Mercury was <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">said</span> to have three heads, as being marine, <span class="reg">celestial</span>, and <span class="reg">terrestrial</span>,  because <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">resided</span> in the water, earth, and <span class="reg">air</span>. <span class="reg">He</span> is reported to be
                         educated by Vulcan, notorious for <span class="reg">thievery</span>, because Mercury is <span class="reg">said</span> to be
                         <span class="reg">inured</span> to fire, which is volatile, and <span class="reg">carries</span> away with it that wherewith
                         it is mixed: Mercury in the <span class="reg">days</span> of old gave <span class="reg">laws</span> and discipline to
                         the <span class="reg">Egyptians</span>, yea religion <span class="reg">also</span> to the <span class="reg">Theban</span>
         <span class="reg">Priests</span>, and to a  great part of the world, because the <span class="reg">Egyptians</span> received polity, and  sacred things from <span class="reg">Chymical</span> institutions, from them the Greeks, from  them the Romans, from those many other nations, as <span class="reg">has</span> been <span class="reg">elsewhere</span> more at large demonstrated. Argus <span class="reg">he</span> slew with a stone, and converted Baltus into a Touchstone called Index. What need many words? All  the volumes of the Chymists <span class="reg">do</span> inculcate nothing <span class="reg">else</span> but Mercury, and
                         sufficiently <span class="reg">confirm</span> his power in this one versicle; What wise men <span class="reg">seek</span> in Hermes is <span class="reg">contained</span>. <span class="reg">He</span> therefore must be sought, till <span class="reg">he</span> be found,  whether his <span class="reg">harbor</span> be in the <span class="reg">air</span>, fire, water, or earth. For <span class="reg">he</span> is in
                         <span class="reg">perpetual</span> motion, running sometimes here sometimes there for the  service of the <span class="reg">Chymical</span> Gods, as their footman, which his office is denoted, some men ascribing to him a daughter named Angelia . . .</div>
