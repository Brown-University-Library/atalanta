         <span class="reg">married</span> Hippodamia the daughter of Oënomaus King of Elis, they report, that, being of

                         Delphos, upon which oracles were by the inspiration of that God from  thenceforth uttered by a Virgin: <span class="reg">So</span> this Tripes (curiously wrought by  Vulcan) coming to my hand, moved by the example of Pelops, I resolved

                         I have not <span class="reg">met</span> with any matter more worthy, or more honest, abuse excepted and excluded: let it be what it will, esteem of my <span class="reg">endeavors</span>, not

                         <span class="reg">represents</span> a compendium of the universe, and is destinated to live three kinds
                         of life, namely a vegetable, in his mothers <span class="reg">womb</span>, where indeed <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">grows</span> and is <span class="reg">increased</span> like a plant; a sensible, <span class="reg">to wit</span> in this world, where for the
                         most part <span class="reg">he</span> is led by the Senses, as all other <span class="reg">animals</span>, from which <span class="reg">he</span> differs, in beginning to exercise the understanding, though imperfectly; and
                         lastly an intelligible, in the other world with God, and the Intelligences,
                         or good <span class="reg">Angels</span>
         <span class="reg">assistant</span> to him; in this life, the nearer a man comes to the
                         divine nature, the more <span class="reg">does</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">rejoice</span> and is delighted in searching out  things <span class="reg">subtle</span>
         <span class="reg">wonderful</span> and rare, by the understanding: and on the contrary,
                         the more a man declines and degenerates to a <span class="reg">bestial</span> kind, the <span class="reg">less</span> is <span class="reg">he</span> affected with them, and is bound to a more <span class="reg">corporeal</span> sense.<span class="note-mark">*</span>

         <span class="reg">Music</span>, whether <span class="reg">vocal</span>, or <span class="reg">instrumental</span>: herein the ancient Philosophers  did <span class="reg">so</span> exercise themselves, that <span class="reg">he</span> was reputed unlearned, and <span class="reg">forced</span> to sing to the Myrtle, who refused the Harp in <span class="reg">festivals</span>, as is declared of
                         Themistocles: in <span class="reg">Music</span> was Socrates instructed, and Plato <span class="reg">himself</span>, who
                         concluded him not harmoniously compounded, that delighted not in <span class="reg">Musical</span> harmony: Pythagoras was very famous in the same, who is <span class="reg">said</span> to have used
                         the symphony of <span class="reg">music</span> morning, and evening to compose the minds of
                         his disciples: for this is a peculiar virtue of <span class="reg">Music</span>, to quicken or refresh the
                         affections by the different <span class="reg">musical</span> measures: <span class="reg">So</span> the Phrygian tune was  by the <span class="reg">Greeks</span> termed <span class="reg">warlike</span>, because it was sung in <span class="reg">war</span>, and upon engagement, and had a singular virtue in stirring up the Spirits of the  Soldiers; instead of which the <span class="reg">Ionic</span> is sometimes used for the same purpose, which was formerly esteemed amatory (as the Phrygian is <span class="subst">

                         Lesbian singers were <span class="reg">always</span>
         <span class="reg">preferred</span> in the judgment of the Spartans:  Fabius <span class="reg">says</span> thus of <span class="reg">Music</span>: <span class="reg">Music</span> is an honest and pleasant recreation most proper for generous <span class="reg">wits</span>: that therefore <span class="reg">we</span> might have these  three objects of the more <span class="reg">spiritual</span> senses, namely <span class="reg">seeing</span> and hearing, as  <span class="reg">also</span> the understanding <span class="reg">itself</span>, as it were in one view and embrace, and
                         insinuate all at once into mens minds for the better understanding thereof,
                         behold <span class="reg">we</span> have <span class="reg">joined</span> the <span class="reg">Optic</span> together with <span class="reg">Music</span>, and sense  with the understanding, that is, things rare to be seen and heard of with
                         <span class="reg">Chymical</span> emblems, which are peculiar to this Science: for all other arts,
                         if they represent emblems of manners, or other things, than of the secrets
                         of nature, this seems different from their scope and end, they being  willing and requisite to be understood by all men; <span class="reg">Chemia</span> not <span class="reg">so</span>,  which as a <span class="reg">chaste</span> virgin ought to be seen through a <span class="reg">veil</span>, and as Diana,
                         not without a garment of various <span class="reg">colors</span>, for reasons <span class="reg">elsewhere</span> expressed: I say, these <span class="reg">four</span>
         <span class="reg">emblematical</span>, feigned, <span class="reg">poetical</span> and <span class="reg">allegorical</span>, picted notions, graved in Venus or Copper, not without Venus or elegancy; most
                         abstruse <span class="reg">Chymical</span> things, and lastly most rare <span class="reg">Musical</span> things to be enucleated by the understanding, you have <span class="reg">altogether</span> in one <span class="reg">book</span>, and may
                         as designed apply them to your <span class="reg">own</span> use, which if it be more <span class="reg">intellectual</span>, than <span class="reg">sensual</span>, the more profitable and <span class="reg">delightful</span> will it be in time:
                         but if it be first in bondage to the sense, there is <span class="reg">no</span> doubt but there will  be a passage from the sense to the understanding as by a <span class="reg">door</span>: for nothing is
                         <span class="reg">said</span> to be in the understanding, which had not admission by some sense,  the understanding of a man new <span class="reg">born</span> being <span class="reg">supposed</span> as a smooth table,  wherein nothing is as yet written, but any thing may be written by the  <span class="reg">help</span> of sense, as a Style: and it is <span class="reg">commonly</span>
         <span class="reg">said</span>, there is <span class="reg">no</span> desire of a
                         thing <span class="reg">unknown</span>, because the senses being inquisitors and messengers must
                         first convey, and as warders <span class="add">the instruments of a <span class="reg">city</span>

                         things: Atalanta is renowned by the Poets for <span class="add">speed in</span> running, in which exercise
                         <span class="reg">she</span> surpassed all her suitors, and therefore, the reward of victory being
