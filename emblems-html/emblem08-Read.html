         <span class="milestone">e08-01</span>Many and <span class="reg">several</span> sorts of birds there are, which as they are indefinite in number, <span class="reg">so</span> are they <span class="reg">unknown</span> to us by names: <span class="milestone">e08-02</span>Story tells us of a very great bird appearing at a  <span class="reg">certain</span> time of the year in a small Isle of the Sea called Ruc, because it can lift
                         up an Elephant with it into the <span class="reg">air</span>. India and America <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">yield</span>
         <span class="reg">Parrots</span> of various <span class="reg">color</span>, Crows, and the like: <span class="milestone">e08-03</span>but it is not the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> intention to inquire after the eggs of these birds: The <span class="reg">Egyptians</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> yearly infest, and as it  were with a <span class="reg">public</span>
         <span class="reg">war</span> denounced prosecute the Eggs of Crocodiles with  weapons of iron; the Philosophers <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">burn</span> their <span class="reg">egg</span> with fire, not to mortify  and destroy it, but that it may receive life and growth; <span class="milestone">e08-04</span>for when a chicken is  from thence produced animated and living, it cannot be <span class="reg">said</span> to be the corruption
                         but generation of it: <span class="milestone">e08-05</span>it <span class="reg">ceases</span> indeed to be an <span class="reg">egg</span> by the privation of the <span class="reg">oval</span> 
         <span class="reg">form</span>, and begins to be an <span class="reg">animal</span> with two feet and volatile by the introduction
                         of a more noble <span class="reg">form</span>: In an <span class="reg">egg</span> are the seeds of both male and female  <span class="reg">joined</span> together under one cover or shell: <span class="milestone">e08-06</span>The <span class="reg">yolk</span> constitutes the chicken,  and the <span class="reg">radical</span> parts and <span class="reg">bowels</span> thereof, the seed of the male being the  former, and <span class="reg">internal</span> efficient: <span class="milestone">e08-07</span>The white <span class="reg">yields</span> matter, or thread and increment to the rudiment as it were to the warp of the chicken: <span class="milestone">e08-08</span>
         <span class="reg">External</span> heat
                         is the first mover, which <span class="reg">does</span> by a <span class="reg">certain</span> circulation of the Elements, together with instinct and guidance of nature introduce a new <span class="reg">form</span> by  changing one thing into another: <span class="milestone">e08-09</span>for water turnes into <span class="reg">air</span>, <span class="reg">air</span> into fire, and
                         fire into earth, upon the conjunction of which, a <span class="reg">specific</span>
         <span class="reg">form</span> being transmitted by the <span class="reg">Stars</span>, an <span class="reg">individual</span> is made of a <span class="reg">certain</span> kind of bird, namely
                         of that, whose <span class="reg">egg</span> it was, and seed infused in it. <span class="milestone">e08-10</span>Is it indeed <span class="reg">said</span> to be smitten
                         with a fiery sword, whilst Vulcan officiating the duty of a midwife gives passage or <span class="reg">egress</span> to the chicken by his axe, as to Pallas out of the <span class="reg">brain</span> of Jupiter: <span class="milestone">e08-11</span>This is that which Basill Valentine affirms, that Mercury was imprisoned by Vulcan at the <span class="reg">command</span> of Mars, and not released, before <span class="reg">he</span> was  <span class="reg">wholly</span>
         <span class="reg">putrified</span> and dead: <span class="milestone">e08-12</span>but this death is to him the <span class="reg">beginning</span> of a new life,  as the corruption or death of an <span class="reg">egg</span> brings new generation and life to the  chicken, <span class="milestone">e08-13</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> an Embryo being freed from that <span class="reg">human</span> vegetable life (which
                         alone <span class="reg">he</span> enjoyed in his mothers <span class="reg">womb</span>, another more perfect is obtained by
                         coming into the light of this world, as by nativity: <span class="milestone">e08-14</span>yea <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">we</span> being deprived of this present life, which <span class="reg">we</span> lead, another most perfect and <span class="reg">eternal</span> is at hand: Thus Lully <span class="reg">does</span> in many places call this fiery sword a  Sharp Spear; <span class="milestone">e08-15</span>because fire <span class="reg">does</span> as a Sharp Spear or sword perforate <span class="reg">bodies</span>,  and make them porous and pervious, that water can penetrate to dissolve
                         and reduce them from <span class="reg">hardness</span> to <span class="reg">softness</span> and tractability. <span class="milestone">e08-16</span>In the
                         <span class="reg">Stomach</span> of a Cormorant, which is of all birds most voracious, are found
                         long and round <span class="reg">worms</span> alive, which are to it as the instrument of heat,
                         they forthwith invading, and as most sharp needles perforating, (as <span class="reg">we</span> have sometimes observed) and <span class="reg">so</span> in a very short time consuming  the <span class="reg">Eels</span> and other fish taken by it, with a <span class="reg">wonderful</span> operation of nature: <span class="milestone">e08-17</span>as therefore heat <span class="reg">pricks</span>, <span class="reg">so</span> a thing pricking sometimes <span class="reg">supplies</span> the
                        
                        
                        
                        <span class="pb">31</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 8.</span> place of heat: upon which consideration that, wherewith the Philosophers <span class="reg">egg</span> ought to be pieced and smitten, may not undeservedly be called a fiery sword:
                         <span class="milestone">e08-18</span>but the Philosophers had rather have it understood of a temperate heat, whereby the <span class="reg">egg</span> is kept <span class="reg">warm</span>, as Morforleus in Turba declares, <span class="milestone">e08-19</span>saying, wise men
                         ought to <span class="reg">burn</span> away moisture first with a slow fire, as is <span class="reg">Showed</span> to us by an
                         example in the generation of a chicken, and where the fire is augmented,  the <span class="reg">vessel</span> must be <span class="reg">stopped</span> on all sides, that the body of the <span class="reg">brass</span>, and the
                         fugitive Spirit thereof may not exhale. <span class="milestone">e08-20</span>But what birds was the <span class="reg">egg</span>? Moscus in the same place; now I Say, <span class="reg">says</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span>, that <span class="reg">no</span> instruments are  made, except of our white, starry, splendid powder, and of the white  stone, of which powder are made <span class="reg">fit</span> instruments for the <span class="reg">egg</span>; yet they
                         have not named the <span class="reg">egg</span>, nor what birds the <span class="reg">egg</span> was . . . . .</div>
