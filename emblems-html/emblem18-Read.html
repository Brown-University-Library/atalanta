      <div class="ab"> Natures way of operating in all <span class="reg">individuals</span> of the universe is to use one<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> single <span class="reg">process</span> to complete and perfect one single motion, as appears in the
                         Anatomy of mans body, in which one muscle serves <span class="reg">only</span> for one motion,  that is, the attractive, but for the expansive another opposite to the first, <span class="reg">so</span> that if any part or member be to be brought into a circular <span class="reg">form</span>, it must
                         be effected by various muscles placed circlewise: <span class="reg">so</span> the operation of fire  is one and single, that is to say, to heat and fire, yea assimilate to <span class="reg">itself</span>, and
                         <span class="reg">burn</span> all things, to which it is <span class="reg">applied</span>, if they be combustible: Hereupon  <span class="reg">Says</span> Avicenne in his <span class="reg">book</span> of the congelation of stones: That which falls into <span class="reg">Saltpits</span>, becomes Salt, and that which into fire, becomes fire, but somethings sooner,  some Slower, according to the power of <span class="reg">actives</span>, and the <span class="reg">resistance</span> of passives: And  there is a place in Arabia, which <span class="reg">colors</span> all <span class="reg">bodies</span> in it of its <span class="reg">own</span>
         <span class="reg">color</span>: <span class="reg">So</span> every <span class="reg">natural</span> thing <span class="reg">possesses</span> the virtue <span class="reg">infused</span> into it by nature, by which
                         it acts upon things <span class="reg">mixed</span> or <span class="reg">applied</span> to it, assimilating and altering their nature
                         and <span class="reg">form</span>: That which is generation in vegetables and <span class="reg">animals</span> by the propagation of seeds, is the infusion of virtue and assimilation in single <span class="reg">bodies</span> or singly <span class="reg">mixed</span>: the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, the light of heaven, projects its <span class="reg">rays</span> upon the
                         earth, which, being gathered together in concavous or burning glasses, <span class="reg">do</span> demonstrate themselves to be produced from such a cause, as to appear to be the  projectible <span class="reg">forms</span> of the <span class="reg">Sun</span>: Whereby it is manifest that the <span class="reg">rays</span> of the
                         <span class="reg">Sun</span> are nothing <span class="reg">else</span>, but a fiery flame extended and dispersed into an ample
                         latitude, which being dilated and <span class="reg">again</span> contracted by concavous, diaphanous  and circular or repercussive instruments, <span class="reg">does</span> in concavous and <span class="reg">steel</span> mirrors
                         Shine as a flame, and <span class="reg">burn</span> things obvious to it: after the same manner, a  <span class="reg">certain</span> virtue is as a <span class="reg">vapor</span> dispersed in a <span class="reg">certain</span> elemented body, which,
                         if it be gathered together, and attracted into one, <span class="reg">turns</span> into water, and that
                         water into earth: For this reason <span class="reg">says</span> Avicenne in the <span class="reg">book</span> before <span class="reg">alleged</span>,
                         Earth is made of water, when the <span class="reg">qualities</span> of earth overcome it, and <span class="reg">so</span> on
                         the contrary: But there is a <span class="reg">certain</span> thing, which some ingenious men <span class="reg">do</span> use when they have a mind to coagulate a dry substance, which is compounded of two waters, and is called Lac virginis, which is the most <span class="reg">certain</span> effect of it: thus <span class="reg">Says</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span>: Some <span class="del">are</span> there are that assure themselves  able to increase or multiply virtues in the Loadstone, as the like <span class="reg">we</span> have
                         seen <span class="reg">set</span> in Silver, which being scarce one pound weight attracted and held up an
                         iron anchor of 28 pounds, which would have been impossible, if the virtue  had not been <span class="reg">increased</span> and made stronger in it, which without doubt was  done by revocation of the dispersed virtues as it were into one point or pole,  or by the attraction of the same out of a great body into a <span class="reg">less</span>: Others are
                         found, who say that a plumbifying Stone may be made by the Sulphurous
                         breath of <span class="reg">Saturn</span>, infused and retained, till it be thereby converted into
                         <span class="reg">common</span> Mercury, which continually converts <span class="reg">common</span> Mercury into lead.  Some boast that they can by Antimony, or the stellated Regulus thereof make Copper from the fume of Copper, in that time wherein a  man may eat an <span class="reg">egg</span>, yea that they have made all <span class="reg">metals</span>: but
                         I will not detract from their reputation, though to <span class="reg">me</span> it seems not
                        
                        
                        
                        <span class="pb">6i</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 18.</span> likely to be true: I know not whether they are more confident or  <span class="reg">successful</span>, who <span class="reg">endeavor</span> to deduce gold from gold, according to the
                         saying of the golden <span class="reg">Poet</span>: <span class="reg">He</span> that desires barley <span class="reg">sows</span>
         <span class="reg">only</span> barley,
                         in gold is the seed of gold: Every <span class="reg">natural</span> thing <span class="reg">has</span> indeed a <span class="reg">certain</span> virtue of multiplying <span class="reg">itself</span>, but these things are brought into action
                         in Vegetables and <span class="reg">animals</span>
         <span class="reg">only</span>, not at all in <span class="reg">Metals</span>, <span class="reg">Minerals</span>, things
                         <span class="reg">dug</span> out of the earth, or Meteors: Some plants sprung from a small
                         <span class="reg">grain</span> of seed <span class="reg">do</span> oftentimes <span class="reg">yield</span> a thousand or more grains of seed,
                         and <span class="reg">so</span> multiply and propagate themselves, and that yearly; <span class="reg">Animals</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> have their Products of greater or <span class="reg">less</span> number, according  to the nature of every one: But gold, Silver, lead, <span class="reg">tin</span>, iron, copper, or
                         Argent vive are never found to have <span class="reg">multiplied</span> themselves or their species  after that manner, though one may be very often found commuted and
                         nobilitated into another: <span class="reg">Nevertheless</span> the Philosophers <span class="reg">affirm</span> that the
                         principle of ignifying is in fire, <span class="reg">so</span> of aurifying in gold: but where is
                         the tincture, by which gold must be made? This must be sought in  its owne principles and generations, not in things of another nature: For
                         if fire <span class="reg">produces</span> fire, a Pear a Pear, a horse a horse, then lead must
                         generate lead and not Silver, gold gold and not the tincture: Moreover
                         the Philosophers have a peculiar gold, which they <span class="reg">do</span> not <span class="reg">only</span> not  deny that it ought (but <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">affirm</span> it necessarily requisite) to be  added to the <span class="reg">aurific</span> Stone as a ferment as the end of the <span class="reg">work</span>. The
                         ferment, converting the thing fermented into its <span class="reg">own</span> nature, without
                         which the whole composition would never come to perfection . . . .</div>
