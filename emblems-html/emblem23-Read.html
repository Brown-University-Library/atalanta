                         When Pallas was <span class="reg">born</span>, and Sol lay with Venus, it rained gold

         <br/>This prodigy seems more than strange to us,<br/>Yet <span class="reg">Greece</span> for truth <span class="reg">has</span> it affirmed thus:<br/>The clouds did twice at Rhodes their joy declare,<br/>
         <span class="reg">Showering</span>
         <span class="reg">down</span> gold through the receding <span class="reg">air</span>;<br/>When Sol to Venus <span class="reg">paid</span> the dues of love,<br/>And Pallas Sprung out of the <span class="reg">brain</span> of Jove.<span class="note-mark">*</span>

      <div class="ab"> It would be <span class="reg">madness</span> to <span class="reg">affirm</span> that gold ever rained upon the earth, except<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> it was allegorically understood: for there are <span class="reg">no</span> golden rivers, or <span class="reg">Mines</span> of  gold veins in the clouds, that it could be <span class="reg">said</span> to be there generated, nor is gold of
                         <span class="reg">so</span> little weight, as to be thought to be attracted with <span class="reg">vapors</span>: but a Trope <span class="reg">admits</span> and <span class="reg">excuses</span> all these things; for <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">truly</span> as Pallas actually sprung
                         from Jupiters <span class="reg">brain</span>, and Sol <span class="reg">committed</span> adultery with Venus, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">truly</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> fell golden <span class="reg">rain</span>; not as if <span class="reg">we</span> doubt both those things to have happened,  but to take away the vulgar and <span class="reg">literal</span> sense from things allegorically
                         spoken: for if <span class="reg">we</span> follow the bare words of this <span class="reg">Emblem</span>, there is nothing
                         more absurd than them, if the meaning, nothing more true. Now Rhodes  is an Island, first called Ophiusa by reason of the multitude of Serpents,  after that Rhodes from the gardens of roses there flourishing, lastly <span class="reg">also</span> Colossicula, from the Colosse of the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, which being there was esteemd
                         among the seven miracles of the world: Hereupon the ancient Philosophers, their crude <span class="reg">Mercurial</span> matter <span class="reg">Showing</span>
         <span class="reg">itself</span> like a Serpent, but
                         after <span class="reg">preparation</span> and coction assuming the purple <span class="reg">color</span> of a rose,  <span class="reg">took</span>
         <span class="reg">certain</span> similitudes from the Island Rhodes: The same <span class="reg">also</span> was
                         the cause, why they <span class="reg">ascribed</span> a golden shower to it, Sol or Apollo having
                         coition with Venus: This thing first tropically spoken gave occasion to
                         the Rhodians (growing more proud, because <span class="reg">so</span> great Gods had begotten
                         children among them) to erect as it were an <span class="reg">idol</span> of the <span class="reg">Sun</span> of  <span class="reg">stupendous</span> magnitude and charge: for that <span class="reg">Colossus</span>, as <span class="reg">histories</span> relate, was 70 cubits high, <span class="reg">so</span> placed, that <span class="reg">Ships</span> might <span class="reg">pass</span> between the <span class="reg">legs</span> of it with full <span class="reg">Sail</span>: the fingers were as <span class="reg">big</span> as  ordinary statues, and few men could <span class="reg">grasp</span> the thumb: the Artist
                         was Chares Lyndius the <span class="reg">Scholar</span> of Lysippus, by <span class="reg">whom</span> it was  made in twelve years: after the fifty sixth year being overturned
                         by an earthquake, it was <span class="reg">also</span> a miracle lying: The <span class="reg">Sultan</span> of  <span class="reg">Egypt</span>, winning and possessing Rhodes, is reported to have laden  900 <span class="reg">Camels</span> with the <span class="reg">brass</span> of this statue: That which Sol is  among the Planets, <span class="reg">says</span> a Philosopher, that is gold amongst <span class="reg">metals</span>;
                         and this is <span class="reg">chiefly</span> appropriated to the <span class="reg">Sun</span> in respect of heat, <span class="reg">color</span>,
                         virtue and essence: for this reason is a golden <span class="reg">rain</span> ascribed to the  generation of Sol: when little <span class="reg">Suns</span> are <span class="reg">conceived</span> by Venus: For Venus <span class="reg">has</span> a rosy <span class="reg">color</span> in her face, and if infused into the seed of  Sol, the offspring from hence produced must really be a Rhodian:  <span class="reg">He</span> is <span class="reg">beautiful</span>, like roses, the <span class="reg">Son</span> of the Philosophers, who  <span class="reg">draws</span> and allures the eyes and minds of all men to him, and deserves love, at whose birth it is <span class="reg">no</span> strange thing if miracles happen: for <span class="reg">he</span> in all his actions will be miraclous, and excite a  golden <span class="reg">rain</span>: This is the brother of Augius the <span class="reg">Son</span> of Sol, <span class="pb">76</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 23.</span> who had Oxen for a patrimony, the dung whereof Hercules purged away
                         in one day: <span class="reg">He</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> is the brother of Ã†eta, who possessed the golden
                         fleece obtained by Jason. Of Pallas <span class="reg">proceeding</span> from the <span class="reg">brain</span> of Jupiter,
                         without a mother, they report, that <span class="reg">she</span> was brought forth at the river
                         Triton, and therefore <span class="reg">called</span> Tritonia: <span class="reg">She</span> is feigned to be the <span class="reg">goddess</span> of <span class="reg">wisdom</span>, who springing from the <span class="reg">brain</span>, the seat of <span class="reg">wisdom</span>, is not
                         without reason <span class="reg">so</span> called: a golden <span class="reg">rain</span> did <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">adorn</span> her nativity at
                         Rhodes, that after birth <span class="reg">she</span> might <span class="reg">remain</span> in the memory of men. In
                         <span class="reg">public</span> or <span class="reg">solemn</span> joy, as at the coronation of a King, or <span class="reg">also</span> the birth
                         of the Kings <span class="reg">heir</span>
         <span class="reg">pieces</span> of gold are sometimes <span class="reg">thrown</span> amongst the  <span class="reg">common</span> people, as golden <span class="reg">rain</span>: <span class="reg">So</span> did the same happen at the birth of
                         Pallas: For Pallas is <span class="reg">wisdom</span>, who <span class="reg">carries</span> health in her right hand, and
                         riches in the left, and provides for mens health and <span class="reg">welfare</span>: To her <span class="reg">Persons</span> brought the saxifying head of Medusa, terrible with serpentine and viperous <span class="reg">hair</span>, which <span class="reg">she</span> used in a <span class="reg">shield</span> against her <span class="reg">enemies</span>, a rude and barbarous people, transmuting them into stones. And indeed <span class="reg">natural</span>
         <span class="reg">wisdom</span> or Philosophy makes those incredulous and envious despisers stupid and
                         <span class="reg">void</span> of sense and understanding by that very thing, (from which Chrysaor
                         was produced, who was the father of the <span class="reg">tricorporeal</span> Geryon <span class="reg">aforesaid</span>),  that is, the petrifying Gorgonian blood, which is nothing <span class="reg">else</span>, but the  tincture of the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> stone . . . . . . . . .</div>
