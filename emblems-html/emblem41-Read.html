      <div class="ab"> How improperly some of the Mythologists resolve the Allegory of <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> Adonis, and ascribe him sometimes to the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, the <span class="reg">Boar</span>, by which
                         <span class="reg">he</span> was <span class="reg">slain</span>, to a hard winter, sometimes to the seed of wheat,  which is six <span class="reg">months</span> with Proserpina under the earth, and as many
                         above the earth with Venus, is <span class="reg">elsewhere</span> sufficiently explained and
                         refuted by us. Here <span class="reg">we</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> with the consent of all men declare the
                         <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">Sun</span> to be meant by Adonis: From whence the Versicle:
                        <div class="verse">
            <br/>Omnia sunt idem, Dionysus, Sol, et Adonis:<br/>And Orpheus:Qui vario l√¶taris nomine Adoni,<br/>Germinum et idem author, pariter puer atq puella.</div> All which are by <span class="reg">no</span> means to be understood of the <span class="reg">celestial</span>, but  <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">Sun</span>; for this <span class="reg">expresses</span> both sexes, that not: <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> they attribute the very same thing to Dionysus, and the <span class="reg">Sun</span>,  as to Adonis, and on the contrary, as <span class="reg">also</span> to Osiris. Adonis is <span class="reg">killed</span> by a
                         <span class="reg">Boar</span>, that is, by Acetum acerrimum, or the solutive water, which <span class="reg">has</span> terrible teeth like a boar, with which <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">tushes</span> Adonis; because the  <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> Sol is <span class="reg">mortals</span> wounded by that boar, loosened in the
                         members and <span class="reg">cut</span>
         <span class="reg">off</span>; But Venus <span class="reg">endeavors</span> to <span class="reg">help</span> her Paramour,  who being dead, <span class="reg">she</span>
         <span class="reg">laid</span> him amongst <span class="reg">Lettuces</span>, and <span class="reg">watched</span> him. After
                         the same manner is Osiris <span class="reg">killed</span> by Typhon, and cut into <span class="reg">several</span>
         <span class="reg">pieces</span>,
                         which Isis, the wife of Osiris, gathered up, and being <span class="reg">joined</span> together <span class="reg">buried</span>. The same mourning, which followed the death of Osiris every  year in <span class="reg">Egypt</span>, was <span class="reg">also</span> celebrated after the death of Adonis in Syria
                         and the bordering kingdoms; where for some <span class="reg">days</span> weeping and wailing
                         being heard, afterwards were signs of joy given, and dancing, as if <span class="reg">he</span>,
                         that was dead, now lived anew being conveyed to heaven: From whence
                         arose the vanity of their religion or heathenish superstition, which  grew to an excessive height, the <span class="reg">Devil</span> giving occasion, and procuring
                         false miracles. Adonis was (as they <span class="reg">feign</span>) <span class="reg">born</span> of Cinyre King of
                         Cyprus, and Myrrha his daughter, <span class="reg">he</span> is <span class="reg">said</span> to be <span class="reg">born</span> in <span class="reg">incest</span> (if
                         history be considered) wicked, if an allegory, not <span class="reg">unlawful</span>, but principally necessary: For if the mother and <span class="reg">Son</span>, or the father and  daughter be not <span class="reg">joined</span> together, and an offspring produced from thence,
                         nothing is perfected in this art. For here, the nearer the man and
                         wife are one to the other in blood, in the first degree of consanguinity, or second, the more <span class="reg">fruitful</span> they are, and on the contrary, the more remote, the more <span class="reg">unfruitful</span>, which is not tolerable
                         in the matrimony of men. For this cause <span class="reg">Oedipus</span>
         <span class="reg">married</span> his <span class="reg">own</span> mother, Jupiter his Sister, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> Osiris, <span class="reg">Saturn</span>, Sol, the red
                         servant, Gabritius; Sol (in a Metaphor of Belinus in the Rosary) <span class="pb">130</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 4i.</span> speaks thus of Adonis, that is, of <span class="reg">himself</span>: Know yee, that my father Sol
                         <span class="reg">has</span> given <span class="reg">me</span> power above all power, and <span class="reg">clothed</span>
         <span class="reg">me</span> with the garment of glory: And a little after: For I am his <span class="reg">only</span>
         <span class="reg">Son</span> and more
                         like my father, etc. I divest my servants of their power and nature,  and <span class="reg">cloth</span> them with my <span class="reg">beautiful</span>
         <span class="reg">splendor</span> and light (which my
                         father gave <span class="reg">me</span>) in all their works: For I am excellent, who <span class="reg">do</span> exalt
                         and <span class="reg">depress</span> all things, and none of my servants is above <span class="reg">me</span>, but one,  who is permitted to be repugnant and contrary to <span class="reg">me</span>: And <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">destroys</span> 
         <span class="reg">me</span>, yet <span class="reg">destroys</span> not my nature: And <span class="reg">he</span> is <span class="reg">Saturn</span>, who separates all
                         my parts: Afterwards I <span class="reg">go</span> to my mother, who gathers together all my  divided and separated members: I illuminate all those things that  <span class="reg">appertain</span> to <span class="reg">me</span>, and cause light to appear openly in the way from
                         my father <span class="reg">Saturn</span>, as <span class="reg">also</span> from my mother, who is an enemy to <span class="reg">me</span>.
                         The words hitherto spoken are <span class="reg">so</span> clear, as to <span class="reg">discuss</span>
         <span class="reg">darkness</span> from
                         the eyes of the mind even to him that is but meanly conversant in  the reading of authors, and discover the light of the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, which is
                         abundantly perspicuous in the <span class="reg">coherencies</span> insinuated of things and persons: For those things which are true, though shaded under the <span class="reg">veil</span> of an allegory, <span class="reg">do</span> consent in <span class="reg">wonderful</span> harmony one with another,  but those things which are false are repugnant, and inconsistent with
                         themselves, and others . . . . . . . . .</div>
