      <div class="ab"> Avicenne in his <span class="reg">book</span> of the <span class="reg">Soul</span>
         <span class="reg">diverse</span> times <span class="reg">admonishes</span>, that <span class="reg">no</span>
         <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> eggs are to be taken for art, but <span class="reg">only</span> of those <span class="reg">hens</span>, which had a cock:
                         that is, the <span class="reg">feminine</span> subject <span class="reg">avails</span> nothing without the masculine  virtue, and on the contrary, nor a <span class="reg">cock</span> profitable without a <span class="reg">hen</span>:
                         for both these sexes must be <span class="reg">joined</span> together in the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">coop</span>,
                         that multiplication may be made: The Philosophers <span class="reg">do</span> indeed use
                         the similitude taken from a <span class="reg">cock</span>, because in the first place <span class="reg">he</span> is  more correspondent to the power of Sulphur, than any other male of
                         birds, one being able to serve many <span class="reg">hens</span>, and not easily suffering a
                         <span class="reg">rival</span> in the same dunghill, thinking <span class="reg">himself</span> convenient and sufficient for everyone. <span class="reg">He</span> is the bird of Mars, <span class="reg">transformed</span>, as the Poets
                         fable, from the youth Gallus, who was entrusted to observe Sol, that  <span class="reg">he</span> might not discover the adultery of Mars with Venus, and very
                         <span class="reg">Martial</span> in fight, contending with his adversary even to death: In  the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">represents</span> Sol, as the <span class="reg">hen</span>
         <span class="reg">does</span> Luna:
                         there is therefore the same necessity of <span class="reg">joining</span> Sol with Luna, as a  <span class="reg">cock</span> with a <span class="reg">hen</span>: The <span class="reg">cock</span> is <span class="reg">also</span> consecrated to Sol, at whose  approach <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">rises</span>, and goes to sleep with him: <span class="reg">he</span> often looks up to  heaven, and erects his hooked <span class="reg">tail</span> upright: <span class="reg">he</span> fights against Serpents in
                         <span class="reg">defense</span> of his <span class="reg">hens</span>: <span class="reg">he</span> is an acceptable messenger of light and Latona  being <span class="reg">present</span> at her <span class="reg">labor</span>: Latona indeed brought forth Sol and Luna,
                         and therefore <span class="reg">he</span> is appropriated to the mother and <span class="reg">Son</span>: But Sol,  Luna, and Latona <span class="reg">do</span> in <span class="reg">Chymical</span> subjects agree, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> the <span class="reg">cock</span> and <span class="reg">hen</span>: but these <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">proceeded</span> from an <span class="reg">egg</span>, and <span class="reg">again</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> lay eggs for the production of young chickens; <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> the Philosophers eggs <span class="reg">turn</span> into birds of the same kind, provided they be kept  <span class="reg">warm</span> with temperate heat, as is the heat of a brooding <span class="reg">hen</span>, which
                         endures continually: For whereas amongst other birds the male <span class="reg">also</span> 
         <span class="reg">sits</span> upon the eggs, the <span class="reg">cock</span> alone <span class="reg">shows</span>
         <span class="reg">himself</span> free from this
                         office or <span class="reg">burden</span>; and therefore all the care and pains of hatching the
                         eggs, and producing chickens <span class="reg">lies</span> upon the <span class="reg">hen</span>; where her sedulity
                         and diligence may be observed, how hastily <span class="reg">She</span> eats and drinks, and
                         unloads her belly, and presently <span class="reg">runs</span>
         <span class="reg">back</span> to her eggs, before they be  cold: Then with what force and violence <span class="reg">She</span> defends her chickens,
                         with what <span class="reg">tenderness</span>
         <span class="reg">She</span> receives and covers them being naked under
                         her wings, with what a <span class="reg">voice</span>, as with a bell, <span class="reg">She</span> calls and keeps them  together, with what study <span class="reg">She</span> breaks the harder <span class="reg">crumbs</span> or seeds for  them, and <span class="reg">presents</span> them with her <span class="reg">beak</span>, as on a knife, this <span class="reg">work</span> of  nature is worthy of admiration. And all these things are, that man
                         may neither want eggs nor chickens for aliment: After the same manner the Philosopher or artist <span class="reg">does</span> most diligently and providently <span class="pb">97</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 30.</span> proceed in all his operations; For <span class="reg">he</span> picks up eggs there where a <span class="reg">cock</span> 
         <span class="reg">has</span> been, trying them whether they be adle, after that <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">cleanses</span> 
         <span class="reg">prepares</span>, and <span class="reg">disposses</span> them in his <span class="reg">vessels</span>, as nests, and administers due
                         heat, whereby the subjects <span class="reg">mixed</span> together daily act and suffer one by  another, till after a long time passing through various <span class="reg">colors</span> they come
                         to one <span class="reg">color</span> and <span class="reg">essense</span>: In which operation Solution, coagulation,
                         Sublimation, ascension, descension, distillation, calcination and fixion
                         as intermediate are perfected: for a hard and compact thing cannot  be altered, therefore Solution is <span class="reg">premised</span>, that is may be made liquid
                         and soft: and where a thing is dissolved, it is convenient <span class="reg">also</span> to be  coagulated, not to its former <span class="reg">hardness</span> but a <span class="reg">honeyish</span> tractability;  Sublimation separates the pure from the impure, and makes a thing
                         vile more worthy, the <span class="reg">inferior</span>
         <span class="reg">superior</span>; and therefore this neither ought to be wanting, for it is as the <span class="reg">mistress</span> and <span class="reg">directness</span> of all: when sublimation is made, some parts ascend higher, which
                         is ascension, and others <span class="reg">again</span> descend, and <span class="reg">so</span> descension is made:
                         Distillation <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">clarifies</span> the whole being often interposed, and that
                         which <span class="reg">remains</span> in the <span class="reg">bottom</span> is calcined: then both are fixed, and
                         <span class="reg">so</span> the <span class="reg">work</span> is completed. But if a man gather all these particular operations under a <span class="reg">general</span>, which is Coction, <span class="reg">he</span> will not  <span class="reg">err</span> much from the purpose: for as <span class="reg">so</span> many chickens as there are,
                         which <span class="reg">run</span> here and there dispersedly, <span class="reg">do</span> resort to one mother or
                         <span class="reg">nurse</span> the <span class="reg">hen</span>, <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> many <span class="reg">several</span>
         <span class="reg">ways</span> of operating <span class="reg">concur</span> to the womans <span class="reg">work</span>, that is, coction alone: It is Luna, which  comes to be exalted to the sublimity of Sol, for whose sake all these
                         things are done, that is, durable matrimony is intended between Sol  and Luna, which if effected, all legations, desponsations, copulations,
                         dubitatious, etc. will cease, and the bed and flesh of both will be one,
                         <span class="reg">mutual</span> and constant love, <span class="reg">eternal</span> peace, and an indissoluble alliance: Sol without Luna is of <span class="reg">no</span> great <span class="reg">esteem</span>, and Luna without
                         Sol of <span class="reg">mean</span> and sordid condition: But <span class="reg">She</span> receives <span class="reg">splendor</span>, and
                         dignity, with strength or constancy of mind and body from Sol her  husband, and Sol from Luna multiplication of offspring, and propagation of kind: hereupon <span class="reg">Says</span> the Rosary: If <span class="reg">only</span> one of them  Should be in our stone, the medicine would never flow easily, nor,  <span class="reg">yield</span> the tincture, and if it should <span class="reg">yield</span>, it would not tinge, <span class="reg">unless</span> for <span class="reg">so</span> much as <span class="reg">also</span> the remainder would be, and the Mercury would
                         evaporate in fume, because the receptacle of the tincture would not
                         be in it: And Geber in his <span class="reg">book</span> of examinations proves, that if Sol  and Luna be incorporated together with art, they are not easily  separated . . . . . . . . . . . .</div>
