      <div class="ab"> It is a thing <span class="reg">known</span> by experience that a <span class="reg">Lion</span>
         <span class="reg">excels</span> other <span class="reg">animals</span> not<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> 
         <span class="reg">so</span> much in <span class="reg">bigness</span> and strength of body, as generosity: if <span class="reg">he</span> be seen in  hunting, being <span class="reg">ashamed</span> to <span class="reg">run</span> away, <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">releases</span>
         <span class="reg">himself</span> by degrees,
                         if <span class="reg">he</span> be <span class="reg">oppressed</span> by a multitude: being removed from the view of the  hunters, <span class="reg">he</span> makes hast away, thinking it a <span class="reg">dishonor</span> to be <span class="reg">excused</span> by absconding: <span class="reg">he</span> desires a wood in flight, which <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">uses</span>, when anything
                         pursues: his bones are solid and not at all empty, which are <span class="reg">said</span> to be
                         <span class="reg">so</span> hard, that being <span class="reg">shaked</span> together they <span class="reg">yield</span> fire as out of a Steel and  flint. <span class="reg">He</span> fears fire above all things. <span class="reg">He</span> seems to derive his substance
                         from the nature of the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, for in force and heat <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">excels</span> other  <span class="reg">animals</span>, as the <span class="reg">Sun</span>
         <span class="reg">does</span> the <span class="reg">Stars</span>: Besides <span class="reg">he</span> is <span class="reg">always</span> beheld with
                         fiery and open eyes, as the <span class="reg">Sun</span> beholds the earth with an open and  fiery eye: a <span class="reg">Lioness</span> fighting for her whelps <span class="reg">fixes</span> her eyes upon the  ground, that <span class="reg">She</span> may not be <span class="reg">afraid</span> of the hunters Staffs and Spears.  where a <span class="reg">Lion</span> perceives the coition of a Leopard, <span class="reg">he</span> takes revenge  upon the <span class="reg">Lioness</span> for adultery, and inflicts severe <span class="reg">punishment</span>;  The <span class="reg">Lioness</span> therefore <span class="reg">washes</span> away the <span class="reg">offense</span> and scent in a river,  or being conscious of the <span class="reg">trespass</span>
         <span class="reg">does</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> accompany the adulterer  flying for fear of the male: Which <span class="reg">wonderful</span> nature of this beast the
                         Philosophers contemplating, have produced <span class="reg">several</span>
         <span class="reg">allegories</span> of the
                         <span class="reg">Lion</span>, as it were <span class="reg">hieroglyphical</span> writings testifying of their secret  <span class="reg">work</span>, observing the <span class="reg">Lion</span> to be a constant, <span class="reg">firm</span>
         <span class="reg">animal</span>, without  <span class="reg">deceit</span> and suspicion, they assimilated the better part of their <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> composition to him: for as <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">flies</span> not, <span class="reg">so</span> neither this:  <span class="reg">he</span> with solid bones, <span class="reg">so</span> this fixed and not to be overcome: and as  the <span class="reg">Lioness</span> is not <span class="reg">always</span> innocent and free from adultery, <span class="reg">so</span> is neither Luna nor Mercury without some blemish, but is <span class="reg">joined</span> by the ignorant sometimes to this, sometimes to that matter, whereby an adulterous conjunction of things discrepant and different in
                         nature rather than true matrimony is established: for the products
                         of a Leopard and <span class="reg">Lioness</span> have <span class="reg">no</span> specious and comely <span class="reg">manes</span> about the <span class="reg">neck</span> and Shoulders; with which <span class="reg">ensign</span> those generated
                         by the <span class="reg">Lion</span> are alone adorned. The <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">Lioness</span> must
                         therefore be <span class="reg">joined</span> to her proper mate or male, and a genuine  and generous whelp will from thence Spring, which may easily
                         be <span class="reg">known</span> by his paw. But the <span class="reg">Lioness</span> must not be any or  what you please, but winged, which may be able to fight and
                         contest with the <span class="reg">Lion</span>, depending upon the <span class="reg">Swiftness</span> of her  plumes, lest (to <span class="reg">wit</span>) <span class="reg">She</span> Should be oppressed by his extraordinary wrath, but to <span class="reg">think</span> upon escape, if at any time <span class="reg">he</span> fall
                         into fury without cause, for <span class="reg">he</span> when <span class="reg">he</span> stops her flying <span class="pb">55</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 16.</span> is incited with greater love towards her, <span class="reg">friendship</span> being made after discord.  But you will say who ever saw a <span class="reg">Lioness</span> with wings, or what can the plumes
                         of a <span class="reg">Lioness</span>
         <span class="reg">avail</span>? There is a deep valley near the <span class="reg">mountain</span>
         <span class="reg">Cithaeron</span>,
                         in which are seen none but flying <span class="reg">Lioness</span>, and at the top of the same  <span class="reg">mountain</span> resorts a red <span class="reg">Lion</span> of that kind, which Hercules killed. The  <span class="reg">Lion</span> therefore must be taken, and brought into the valley, and forthwith
                         coupled to the winged <span class="reg">Lioness</span>: <span class="reg">She</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> will easily suffer <span class="reg">herself</span> to
                         be overcome, as like by like: afterwards they must be both advanced
                         out of the <span class="reg">said</span> valley to the top of the <span class="reg">mountain</span>, and henceforth they
                         will never desert one another, but <span class="reg">always</span>
         <span class="reg">remain</span> together in inviolable
                         amity: The taking of <span class="reg">Lions</span>. I <span class="reg">confess</span>, is not easy, but obnoxious to many  dangers, <span class="reg">nevertheless</span> it must be attempted: a <span class="reg">Lion</span> feeds not with the  <span class="reg">Lioness</span>, but <span class="reg">strays</span> apart, as story relates, therefore they are to be found and
                         hunted severally: But if the <span class="reg">Lions</span> whelps be <span class="reg">obtained</span> in their infancy, when
                         they first begin to <span class="reg">go</span>, which is at two <span class="reg">months</span> age, and be <span class="reg">joined</span>, as <span class="reg">said</span>, being come to good growth and stature, the thing will be free from  any danger. Moreover <span class="underline">they breed in the Spring time, which must be well
                         observed: b</span>ut <span class="reg">Lions</span> after whelping using <span class="reg">cross</span> and winding <span class="reg">ways</span>, to
                         <span class="reg">prevent</span> the discovery of their <span class="reg">den</span>, therefore must they be sought and
                         their whelps taken away with very great diligence and care . . . .</div>
