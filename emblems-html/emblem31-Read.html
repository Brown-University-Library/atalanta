      <div class="ab"> The first rudiments of all discipline were anciently the knowledge of <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> swimming, and instruction in learning: hereupon because the proverb of an
                         ignorant and <span class="reg">unpolished</span> man, that <span class="reg">he</span> could neither <span class="reg">swim</span> nor read:
                         For the Ancients <span class="reg">considered</span> swimming as a means often times to save and  deliver the body from the dangers of water, and the knowledge of learning
                         the mind from the waves of fortune: Moreover swimming is very serviceable in time of <span class="reg">war</span>, the knowledge of learning in time of peace at  home: And as <span class="reg">we</span> observe that brutes have their weapons in <span class="reg">readiness</span>, provided by nature, man hands and <span class="reg">wit</span>
         <span class="reg">administered</span> instead thereof against  <span class="reg">external</span> violence, <span class="reg">wit</span> to contrive and invent weapons, hands to make and
                         use them, <span class="reg">so</span> is the faculty of swimming naturally invested in the same
                         beasts, but not in man: they even young <span class="reg">do</span> often escape out of waters by  swimming, in which a man though old or never <span class="reg">so</span> strong is suffocated;  <span class="reg">Needful</span> therefore it was to <span class="reg">enjoin</span> the exercise of swimming to children, being often times most conducible to <span class="reg">preserve</span> a mans life, that that which was
                         wanting by nature, might be <span class="reg">supplied</span> by the use of art: The same exercise
                         have Noblemen, Princes, and Kings used for the safeguard of their body, for  those descended from noble blood are not <span class="reg">wholly</span> exempt from the chances of
                         fortune, but exposed to them as well as other men: If Dionysius had <span class="reg">known</span> neither swimming nor learning, when <span class="reg">he</span> was driven out of the <span class="reg">kingdom</span> of Sicily as a tyrant, <span class="reg">he</span> had perished by the waves of the Sea being <span class="reg">Shipwrecked</span> in
                         the Corinthian <span class="reg">gulf</span>, but escaping the dangers by swimming, <span class="reg">he</span> went to  Corinthus, where <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">set</span> up a <span class="reg">school</span> to teach <span class="reg">boys</span>, and <span class="reg">professed</span>
         <span class="reg">human</span> learning, of a King being made a <span class="reg">Schoolmaster</span>, and holding a rod in stead
                         of a Scepter, from whence that jeering Proverb, Dionysius of <span class="reg">Corinth</span>: In  like manner if the <span class="reg">royal</span>
         <span class="reg">Son</span> of the Philosophers had not been able
                         to <span class="reg">swim</span>, <span class="reg">no</span> man would have heard his <span class="reg">voice</span>, nor <span class="reg">relieved</span> him, being  long since drowned in the waters: swimming therefore is necessary and  <span class="reg">commodious</span> to all degrees of men: for though it cannot deliver a man presently
                         from the surges of the vast ocean, yet it gives time of life, whereby <span class="reg">he</span> may be saved by others: But the <span class="reg">said</span> King <span class="reg">sustains</span>
         <span class="reg">himself</span> a long  time, and <span class="reg">cries</span> out hitherto, though <span class="reg">he</span> be heard or seen by very few by  reason of the <span class="reg">largeness</span> of the Sea, and <span class="reg">remoteness</span> of it: for by chance <span class="reg">he</span> 
         <span class="reg">has</span>
         <span class="reg">touched</span> upon a <span class="reg">rock</span> or great stone in swimming, by which to be <span class="reg">preserved</span>, if the waves <span class="reg">prevail</span>. But the <span class="reg">question</span> is what is the Sea? I answer, the <span class="reg">Erythaean</span> or red sea, subject to the <span class="reg">Tropic</span> of Cancer, in  which, there being great store of <span class="reg">Magnets</span> in the <span class="reg">bottom</span>, it is not safe for
                         <span class="reg">Ships</span> compacted or laden with iron to <span class="reg">sail</span>: for they might easily be  <span class="reg">drawn</span> to the <span class="reg">bottom</span> by the virtue of the <span class="reg">Magnet</span>: which the <span class="reg">said</span> King
                         being ignorant of, and the rest perishing the Ship being <span class="reg">sunk</span>, <span class="reg">he</span> alone
                         escaped by swimming. His <span class="reg">Crown</span> shining with orient <span class="reg">Rubies</span> continued
                         with him, by which <span class="reg">he</span> might easily be <span class="reg">known</span>, and restored to his <span class="pb">100</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 31.</span> 
         <span class="reg">kingdom</span>: But what are those good things, which this <span class="reg">royal</span>
         <span class="reg">Son</span> is able or
                         willing to <span class="reg">confer</span> on him, by <span class="reg">whom</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> Should be restored to his <span class="reg">own</span>
         <span class="reg">kingdom</span>? certainly not such, as <span class="reg">Ptolemy</span> the last King of <span class="reg">Egypt</span>
         <span class="reg">bestowed</span> on
                         Pompey, by <span class="reg">whom</span> his father was restored to the <span class="reg">kingdom</span> of <span class="reg">Egypt</span>, to <span class="reg">wit</span>,
                         <span class="reg">perfidiousness</span> and death, but health, the <span class="reg">removal</span> of diseases, the <span class="reg">preservation</span> of life from them, the use of things necessary, and the <span class="reg">horn</span> of  plenty, <span class="reg">honor</span> and love; which not being vulgar or <span class="reg">mean</span> things, but
                         the <span class="reg">chief</span>
         <span class="reg">viatics</span> and ornaments of this life, who, but a man of lead,  would not desire them? who would not stretch forth his hand, and draw
                         him into the boat? but <span class="reg">he</span> must see that in helping him his <span class="reg">Diadem</span> fall
                         not into the sea: for then <span class="reg">he</span> could scarce be <span class="reg">known</span> for the King, nor  received by his subjects, because the venerable Pyropus would perish, because the Bezoar Stone, assuring health to all men, would be lost: The Rosary alluding hereto cites Aristotle in these words: Chose you a Stone, by
                         which Kings are revered in their Diadems, and by which <span class="reg">Physicians</span> can
                         cure their patients, because it is near to fire: for without a <span class="reg">medicinal</span> virtue a <span class="reg">Crown</span> would be of <span class="reg">no</span> value. But what must be done to
                         the King now delivered? <span class="reg">he</span> must be freed from the water which <span class="reg">he</span> received in by <span class="reg">Sudorifics</span>, from cold by the heat of fire, from <span class="reg">numbness</span> and stupefaction of the parts by baths moderately <span class="reg">hot</span>, from  hunger and want of food by the administration of convenient <span class="reg">diet</span>, and
                         from other <span class="reg">external</span>
         <span class="reg">maladies</span> by their <span class="reg">contraries</span> even wholesome <span class="reg">remedies</span>: Then <span class="reg">he</span> must be provided of <span class="reg">royal</span> matrimony, and in due  time a most <span class="reg">hopeful</span> heir will be generated by him, most acceptable to
                         all men, most <span class="reg">beautiful</span> and most <span class="reg">fruitful</span>, who will <span class="reg">excel</span> all his Ancestors in power, kingdoms, dominions, people, wealth and riches, and will
                         subject his <span class="reg">enemies</span> to <span class="reg">himself</span>, not by <span class="reg">war</span>, but humanity, not by
                         tyranny, but clemency, which is genuine and peculiar to him . . .</div>
