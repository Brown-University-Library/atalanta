         <span class="reg">feign</span> Geryon King of <span class="reg">Spain</span> to have been <span class="reg">tricorporeal</span>, <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> who had oxen of a purple <span class="reg">color</span>, which a <span class="reg">dog</span> with two heads, and a Dragon
                         with seven were <span class="reg">charged</span> with as warders: and the same Geryon is reported to be
                         the <span class="reg">Son</span> of Chrysaor sprung from the blood of Medusa, and that Dragon the  <span class="reg">Son</span> of Typhon, and Echidna: which things <span class="reg">agreeing</span> with <span class="reg">no</span>
         <span class="reg">history</span>, or truth
                         of the matter, as it sounds, and making a <span class="reg">noise</span> in all <span class="reg">Chymical</span>
         <span class="reg">Allegories</span>,  they are not without added hereto by us: But by the three <span class="reg">bodies</span> of Geryon <span class="reg">we</span> 
         <span class="reg">mean</span> three faces beheld in one father, according to the sense of Hermes, or as  others would have it, <span class="reg">four</span>, having regard to <span class="reg">so</span> many Elements: For of a Quadrangle ought a triangle to be made, as that made of a circle, <span class="reg">so</span> this to <span class="reg">return</span> into a circle: And the consanguinity and <span class="reg">natural</span> conjunction of the
                         <span class="reg">bodies</span> of Geryon, or the Elements is <span class="reg">so</span> great, that one being overcome or  <span class="reg">killed</span>, the rest <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">die</span> of themselves and putrefy, without the administration
                         of any <span class="reg">manual</span> force: As to things with two <span class="reg">bodies</span> it is <span class="reg">known</span>, that one being
                         dead, the other <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">wastes</span> and consumes: as in Italy <span class="reg">we</span> have seen a boy  <span class="reg">four</span> years of age with two <span class="reg">bodies</span>, who absconded the head of his brother cleaving
                         to him, within his <span class="reg">own</span> body, the other parts hung <span class="reg">down</span> to the <span class="reg">navel</span>, where
                         they were bound or <span class="reg">joined</span> together: But if <span class="reg">he</span>, that hung <span class="reg">down</span>, and being
                         much <span class="reg">less</span>, was <span class="reg">carried</span> by the other, Should be <span class="reg">touched</span> about the hands or  feet too hard, the bigger did hereby <span class="reg">feel</span>
         <span class="reg">pain</span>, yea <span class="reg">also</span> hunger, if the <span class="reg">less</span> wanted food: And this is the combination and sympathy of nature, whereby
                         the members and parts of one body, or <span class="reg">joined</span> with another are mutually  moved and affected together; whereof if one sound and unhurt, yet  the other <span class="reg">do</span> not thereby necessarily continue sound and unhurt, but if
                         <span class="reg">grievously</span> hurt, the rest <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> sympathize, and perish by the same  malady: <span class="reg">So</span> if a <span class="reg">neighbor</span> gains much, <span class="reg">no</span> profit thereby <span class="reg">accrues</span> to his  <span class="reg">neighbor</span>, but if <span class="reg">he</span> Suffers <span class="reg">loss</span> by fire, his <span class="reg">neighbor</span> receives much  damage: for your <span class="reg">affairs</span> are in danger when your <span class="reg">neighbors</span> house <span class="reg">has</span> taken fire: It is not therefore a thing contradictory to truth, for the other
                         three to <span class="reg">die</span>, by the destruction of one of these <span class="reg">four</span> brethren, <span class="reg">seeing</span> that
                         it may happen <span class="reg">diverse</span>
         <span class="reg">ways</span>, either by finding the same ends as <span class="reg">beginnings</span> of life being <span class="reg">born</span> at one birth both by father and mother, as <span class="reg">we</span> have read has happened to some, perhaps by the inclination of the
                         <span class="reg">stars</span>, or by being <span class="reg">joined</span> together not <span class="reg">only</span> in <span class="reg">souls</span>, but <span class="reg">also</span> ligaments
                         of the body, or by consternation of mind, by strong imagination in time
                         of pestilence, or by the vow of a league: A <span class="reg">certain</span> heathenish people
                         <span class="reg">lived</span> by the name of Pythagoreans in the <span class="reg">Indies</span> under the government of the great <span class="reg">Mogul</span> (who now reigns there the nineth of the  Successors of Tamberlan) amongst <span class="reg">whom</span> this ancient <span class="reg">custom</span> is hitherto observed, that if the husband <span class="reg">die</span>, his wife is <span class="reg">burned</span> with fire, or as  now, lives perpetually in the highest infamy, deserted by all, and <span class="reg">esteemed</span> as a dead woman, which was therefore done, that the wives  might not kill themselves by <span class="reg">poison</span> for their husbands, <span class="reg">unless</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="pb">64</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 19.</span> they were willing to <span class="reg">die</span>: <span class="reg">So</span> in the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span>
         <span class="reg">work</span>, one of the brethren being dead, the other <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span> perish by fire, not compulsively, but
                         voluntarily, that they may not survive in sorrow and infamy: or if one be
                         assaulted with a club, sword, or stone, <span class="reg">he</span> will commence <span class="reg">civil</span>
         <span class="reg">war</span> with
                         his brethren, as appears in the <span class="reg">Giants</span> sprung from the teeth of a dragon  opposing Jason, and elswhere <span class="reg">also</span> Cadmus, and <span class="reg">so</span> they will all fall by  <span class="reg">mutual</span> destruction: For touch or hurt him that <span class="reg">carries</span>
         <span class="reg">air</span>, and <span class="reg">he</span> will
                         insurge against those two together which are nearest to him, namely him
                         that <span class="reg">carries</span> water, and him that <span class="reg">carries</span> fire, and these will on both sides  oppose themselves <span class="reg">against</span> him that <span class="reg">carries</span> earth, and him that first promoted the <span class="reg">quarrel</span>, till they have given and received <span class="reg">mutual</span> wounds, of  which they <span class="reg">die</span>: For it is thus decreed amongst the brethren, that the more  earnestly and vehemently they love one another, if once they begin to hate,  they are not to be reconciled, but pursue one another to death, as the most  bitter choler is generated from the sweetest honey in a <span class="reg">stomach</span> too <span class="reg">hot</span>, or the
                         Liver being corrupted. Kill therefore him that is alive, but <span class="reg">so</span>, as being dead
                         to quicken him <span class="reg">again</span>, otherwise the death of him <span class="reg">killed</span>
         <span class="reg">avails</span> you nothing;  for death will manifest him, that is to say, after resurrection, and death,  <span class="reg">darkness</span>, and the sea will fly from him, as Hermes asserts, and the Dragon  which <span class="reg">observed</span> the holes will <span class="reg">avoid</span> the <span class="reg">rays</span> of the <span class="reg">Sun</span>, and our dead  <span class="reg">Son</span>
         <span class="reg">lives</span>, and the King <span class="reg">comes</span> by fire: Bellinus in his Metaphor in the<span class="note-mark">*</span>
         <div class="margin-note">
            <span class="note-mark">*</span>Chapt 3...</div> Rosary <span class="reg">signifies</span> the same thing, saying: And let this be done, when you  have <span class="reg">drawn</span>
         <span class="reg">me</span> partly from my nature, and my wife partly from her  nature, you must then <span class="reg">also</span> kill the natures, and <span class="reg">we</span> are quickened by  a new and <span class="reg">spiritual</span> resurrection, <span class="reg">so</span> that afterwards <span class="reg">we</span> cannot <span class="reg">die</span>. .</div>
