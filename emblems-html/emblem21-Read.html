      <div class="ab"> It is the doctrine of that <span class="underline">most famous Philosopher Plato th</span>at knowledge is as<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> it were actually engraven and imprinted in the mind of man, which is as the
                         foundation of all arts and Sciences, by the remembrance and repetition of  which all learning may be <span class="reg">known</span> and apprehended by any man; which  to prove, <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">introduces</span> a youth yet very young, ignorant, and illiterate,  <span class="reg">whom</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span> instructed first in <span class="reg">geometrical</span> interrogations <span class="reg">so</span>, that the
                         youth was observed to answer directly to all <span class="reg">questions</span>, and nolens volens, or
                         without consideration to have <span class="reg">attained</span> to the very marrow of <span class="reg">so</span> intricate
                         a Science: From whence <span class="reg">he</span> concludes that <span class="reg">no</span> doctrine and discipline is  learned or understood at the first, but <span class="reg">only</span> by remembrance and repetition recalled and revolved into the mind by children, alluding to his Annus magnus, wherein before the solary of 48 thousand yeares the same
                         persons, things and actions were <span class="reg">said</span> by him to have been before the revolution of the heaven, after the same manner, as now: But these things  every man understands are like dreams without any foundation of truth:
                         That there are some <span class="reg">certain</span> sparks of knowledge naturally radicated in
                         us, and mere powers, to be reduced into action by use and instruction, <span class="reg">we</span> 
         <span class="reg">do</span> not deny, but <span class="reg">we</span> deny that they are <span class="reg">so</span> great and of such quality,
                         as to be the <span class="reg">seminaries</span> of arts and sciences without any <span class="reg">precedent</span> 
         <span class="reg">preparation</span>: From whence therefore came Sciences and arts, if men invented them not, others may <span class="reg">ask</span> the <span class="reg">question</span>, whether they were first
                         taught by heaven, or by the Gods of the heathen? I answer, it is one  thing to say, that burning <span class="reg">coals</span> are covered under ashes in <span class="reg">so</span> great plenty,
                         that if they may <span class="reg">only</span> appear by removing the ashes, they are sufficient
                         to <span class="reg">boil</span> meat, or <span class="reg">warm</span> our cold limbs; it is another thing to <span class="reg">affirm</span>, that
                         small sparks <span class="reg">only</span>
         <span class="reg">do</span> there <span class="reg">lie</span> hid, which, before they can be <span class="reg">useful</span> for <span class="reg">boiling</span> or warming, must by the industry, art, and care of man <span class="reg">bestirred</span> up, quickened, and <span class="reg">nourished</span> with <span class="reg">fuel</span>, otherwise they may easily
                         be extinguished, and <span class="reg">wholly</span> reduced into cold ashes: The last is the assertion of the Aristotelians, the first of the Platonists: With the last agrees
                         reason and experience, with the first <span class="reg">only</span>
         <span class="reg">fantasy</span> or imagination: Whereupon it might be demanded, why Plato wrote upon the <span class="reg">door</span> of his <span class="reg">School</span>,
                         that <span class="reg">he</span> that was ignorant of Geometry Should not be admitted into it, <span class="reg">he</span> 
         <span class="reg">also</span> having affirmed that children actually knew it? are men more unlearned than <span class="reg">boys</span>? or have those of full age forgotten those things which  <span class="reg">boys</span> know? that cannot be supposed: because <span class="reg">we</span> see that a brute <span class="reg">does</span> by the instinct of nature <span class="reg">abhor</span> and <span class="reg">avoid</span> the dangers of fire, water,
                         sudden chance, and the like, though newly come into the world, yet that
                         an infant <span class="reg">knows</span> not or <span class="reg">shuns</span> such things, except hurt, or his finger being
                         a little burnt at the flame of a candle like a <span class="reg">Firefly</span>, which <span class="reg">burns</span> its
                         wings and falls <span class="reg">down</span>: why <span class="reg">do</span> not the young bee, the <span class="reg">fly</span> and <span class="reg">gnat</span> fly directly into fire, they not knowing by experience the danger from  thence arising? because nature <span class="reg">has</span> taught them, but not a child new

         <span class="reg">born</span>. If Geometry be <span class="reg">so</span>
         <span class="reg">natural</span> and easy to children, how comes it to <span class="reg">pass</span> that the Square of a circle was not <span class="reg">known</span> to Plato <span class="reg">himself</span>, <span class="reg">So</span> that Aristotle the <span class="reg">Scholar</span> of Plato affirmed it possible to be <span class="reg">known</span>, but not as yet  <span class="reg">known</span>; but it is evident that it was not <span class="reg">unknown</span> to the <span class="reg">natural</span> Philosophers, because they <span class="reg">command</span> a circle to be converted into a quadrangle, and
                         this, by a triangle, <span class="reg">again</span> into a circle: by which they <span class="reg">mean</span> a most simple
                         body without angles, as by a quadrangle, the <span class="reg">four</span> Elements, as if they  Should say, the most simple <span class="reg">corporal</span> figure, that can be found, must be
                         taken, and that divided into four <span class="reg">elemental</span>
         <span class="reg">colors</span>, and to be a quadrangle
                         <span class="reg">equilateral</span>. Now that this quadration is <span class="reg">Physical</span> and <span class="reg">agreeable</span> to nature,  every man understands; by which <span class="reg">far</span> more utility <span class="reg">accrues</span> to a <span class="reg">Commonwealth</span> as <span class="reg">also</span> more illustration to the mind of man, than by that <span class="reg">Mathematical</span> and merely <span class="reg">theoretical</span> or from an abstracted matter: To <span class="reg">learn</span> that perfectly, a Geometrician acting about solid <span class="reg">bodies</span> must inquire what depth of  Solid figures, for example, of Sphere and Cube can be <span class="reg">known</span>, and <span class="reg">transferred</span> to <span class="reg">manual</span> use or practice: If the capacity or circumference of a Sphere be
                         of 32 foot, how much one of the sides of the Cube will be to <span class="reg">equalize</span> the  capacity of this Sphere, on the contrary, if a Sphere <span class="reg">contain</span> 32 measures
                         in <span class="reg">so</span> great a circumference, how much will one side of the Cube be, to  <span class="reg">contain</span>
         <span class="reg">so</span> much, or by looking <span class="reg">back</span> from the measures, which the Sphere
                         or Cube <span class="reg">contains</span>, to the feet of every circumference: In like manner the
                         Philosophers would have the quadrangle reduced into a triangle, that is, into
                         body, Spirit, and <span class="reg">Soul</span>, which three <span class="reg">do</span> appear in three <span class="reg">previous</span>
         <span class="reg">colors</span> before <span class="reg">redness</span>, for example, the body or earth in the <span class="reg">blackness</span> of Saturn,
                         the Spirit in a lunar <span class="reg">whiteness</span>, as water, the <span class="reg">Soul</span> or <span class="reg">air</span> in a solar
                         citrinity: then will the triangle be perfect, but this likewise must be  changed into a circle, that is, into an invariable <span class="reg">redness</span>: By which operation the woman is converted into the man, and made one with him,
                         and the senary the first number of the perfect completed by one, two,
                         having returned <span class="reg">again</span> to an <span class="reg">unit</span>, in which is <span class="reg">eternal</span> rest and peace.
