         <span class="reg">We</span> daily in many places hear birds prattling or imitating the <span class="reg">voice</span>
         <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> of man, such as <span class="reg">Parrots</span>, Ravens, Dawes, and <span class="reg">Pies</span>. <span class="reg">So</span> Pliny writes  that, at the time wherein <span class="reg">he</span> published his history, Agrippina the  wife of Claudius <span class="reg">Caesar</span> had a thrush, imitating the speech of men.  The young <span class="reg">Caesars</span> had <span class="reg">also</span> a Starling and Nightingales accustomed to
                         the <span class="reg">Greek</span> and <span class="reg">Latin</span> tongue, and daily speaking new things, with  a long <span class="reg">form</span> of words <span class="reg">also</span>. But such birds now frequently happening
                         they are thought <span class="reg">less</span> worthy of admiration, for all birds <span class="reg">endued</span> with a broad tongue may by use and <span class="reg">custom</span> be brought to <span class="reg">speak</span> and babble. But that <span class="reg">Vulture</span>, which the Philosophers make mention
                         of, did not <span class="reg">learn</span> words, if any <span class="reg">he</span> utters, by use, but his nature tacitly <span class="reg">expresses</span> them. The Philosophers <span class="reg">do</span> indeed say, that <span class="reg">he</span> continually <span class="reg">cries</span> out, and with a loud <span class="reg">Voice</span>
         <span class="reg">pronounces</span>, who and
                         what <span class="reg">he</span> is, wherein <span class="reg">he</span> imitates great Princes, who in the <span class="reg">beginning</span> of their intimations will <span class="reg">always</span> make their titles and inheritances  <span class="reg">known</span>, not in token of any pride, but for other reasons, that they  <span class="reg">also</span> themselves may know, what <span class="reg">principalies</span> they <span class="reg">govern</span>, or  right of inheritance they <span class="reg">pretend</span> to: <span class="reg">So</span> it is very <span class="reg">material</span> to  know, what <span class="reg">colors</span>, as ensigns of <span class="reg">arms</span> and titles, the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> bird is <span class="reg">adorned</span> with, and wherein <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">excels</span> all others. I, <span class="reg">Says</span>
         <span class="reg">he</span>,
                         as Rosarius <span class="reg">has</span> it from Hermes, am the <span class="reg">black</span> of white, and the citrine of red, and certainly I <span class="reg">speak</span> truth and <span class="reg">lie</span> not. <span class="reg">He</span>
         <span class="reg">affirms</span> 
         <span class="reg">himself</span> blacke, white, citrine, and red, and such <span class="reg">he</span> really is, for  though <span class="reg">he</span>
         <span class="reg">does</span> not as yet actually <span class="reg">possess</span> the last <span class="reg">colors</span>, yet <span class="reg">he</span> expects the inheritance of them: Hereupon <span class="reg">Says</span> Rosinus in his <span class="reg">book</span> of divine interpretations; Take the Stone, which is <span class="reg">black</span>, white,  red, citrine, that admirable bird, which <span class="reg">flies</span> without wings in the
                         <span class="reg">darkness</span> of the night, and <span class="reg">clearness</span> of the day: For coloration  <span class="reg">arises</span> from the <span class="reg">bitterness</span> which is in his throat, but mere water  proceeds from his blood, as Alexander <span class="reg">said</span>. Take (My <span class="reg">Son</span>) the
                         Stone of four <span class="reg">colors</span>. The Philosophers books <span class="reg">do</span> abundantly declare and insinuate that the Stone <span class="reg">has</span> all these <span class="reg">colors</span>, which
                         are <span class="reg">principal</span>, in a successive order. But why the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> subject is <span class="reg">called</span> a <span class="reg">Vulture</span>, there is reason to be <span class="reg">alleged</span>. Of <span class="reg">Vultures</span> the <span class="reg">black</span> are of most esteem, they are rapacious, but fly Slowly, because of the <span class="reg">bigness</span> of body. They say that this bird conceives  without the seed of the males, and generates without coition, and
                         that their offspring <span class="reg">do</span> arrive to a great age even to a hundred  years. Their nests they build in high rocks, <span class="reg">no</span> man <span class="reg">has</span> attained
                         to them. Two chickens are for the most part seen: They are <span class="reg">helpful</span> and commodious <span class="reg">against</span> Serpents. They are offended and <span class="pb">136</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 43.</span> perplexed with the East wind. When they begin to lay eggs, they  bring a thing out of the <span class="reg">Indies</span>, which is as a <span class="reg">nut</span>, having within a  thing that may be moved, and forthwith <span class="reg">yields</span> a sound, which when
                         they have <span class="reg">applied</span> to them, they produce many young chickens,  but one <span class="reg">only</span>
         <span class="reg">remains</span>, which is <span class="reg">called</span> Immusulus. Hermodorus Fonticus in <span class="reg">Caelius</span> is a <span class="reg">witness</span>, that <span class="reg">Vultures</span> of all <span class="reg">animals</span> are the  most innocent, because they <span class="reg">do</span> not at all meddle with any of those
                         things which men sow, plant, and breed. Moreover they kill <span class="reg">no</span> 
         <span class="reg">animals</span>. They <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">abstain</span> from birds though dead by a <span class="reg">certain</span> instinct of affinity: For this cause they were best <span class="reg">esteemed</span> in divinations, as the <span class="reg">originals</span> of the <span class="reg">City</span> of Rome declare. The <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> bird expressing <span class="reg">almost</span> all these <span class="reg">properties</span> of <span class="reg">Vultures</span>, is
                         therefore by Hermes and others not undeservedly called <span class="reg">Vulture</span>, which
                         is <span class="reg">also</span> slow in flight, and <span class="reg">black</span> of <span class="reg">color</span>; It conceives by <span class="reg">itself</span>:
                         For thus <span class="reg">says</span> Rosarius about the end; And it is the Dragon, which
                         <span class="reg">weds</span>
         <span class="reg">itself</span>, and <span class="reg">impregnates</span>
         <span class="reg">itself</span>, and brings forth in its <span class="reg">own</span> season etc. And Rosinus to Sarratant: And that is the Serpent, <span class="reg">administering</span> pleasure to <span class="reg">itself</span>, impregnating <span class="reg">itself</span>, and bringing
                         forth in one day, etc. It lives and endures a very long time, and  <span class="reg">multiplies</span>
         <span class="reg">itself</span>. For that which <span class="reg">Virgil</span> writes of the bird <span class="reg">called</span> a <span class="reg">Phoenix</span>, is as proper to this, because it is the same.
                        <div class="verse">
            <br/>Alipedem Cervum Corvus ter vincit, at illum<br/>Multiplicat novies <span class="reg">Phoenix</span> reparabilis ales.</div>
         <div class="verse">
            <br/>Three ages of a Hart the Raven lives,<br/>Which the rare <span class="reg">Phoenix</span> nine times <span class="reg">over</span> survives.</div> It is very difficult to <span class="reg">climb</span> this birds nest: It fights with the <span class="reg">Mercurial</span> serpent, and overcomes it, that is, Sol with Luna. It is conceived by  the wind, and <span class="reg">carried</span> in its belly, and bred in the <span class="reg">air</span>. The  Stone Ætites, containing a little stone sounding within <span class="add">it</span> is by many
                         men called Totium. One <span class="reg">only</span> Immusulus is found in the Philosophers nest. The <span class="reg">Philosophic</span> bird is <span class="reg">also</span> most innocent, because
                         it hurts <span class="reg">no</span> body, it is <span class="reg">beneficial</span> to all that know it, and most excellent in divinations. But why <span class="reg">does</span> it make its nest on a <span class="reg">Mountain</span>,
                         and sitting <span class="reg">so</span> cry out? Rosinus answers according to Rasis, who <span class="reg">says</span> Behold the most high mountains, which are both on the right and
                         left, and <span class="reg">climb</span> up thither: There is our Stone found, and in another
                         <span class="reg">mountain</span>, which <span class="reg">produces</span> all sorts of Painter <span class="reg">colors</span>, and Spirits  or Species, there likewise it is: Morienus: <span class="reg">Climb</span> up the high mountains,
                         planted wih trees, because there is our stone found, and hidden: And Hermes:
                         Take yee the blessed Stone, <span class="reg">break</span> it to <span class="reg">pieces</span>, and wash the red stone, from
                         which is extracted that which is found in mountains, and especially sometimes in old Sinks.
