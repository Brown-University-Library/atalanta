      <div class="ab"> The miracles of waters are <span class="reg">so</span> many and <span class="reg">so</span> great, as scarce to be <span class="milestone">e03-01</span> comprehended in a large volume, concerning which <span class="reg">several</span> authors  have here and there treated: But above all the two <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> waters are celebrated with that name, because they <span class="reg">do</span> as it were not <span class="reg">only</span>
         <span class="reg">emulate</span>, but <span class="reg">also</span> exceed the virtues and <span class="reg">properties</span> of all the rest.  The rivers Sybaris, Axus of Macedonia, and Melas of <span class="reg">Boeotia</span> make  Cattle <span class="reg">black</span>, if they <span class="reg">drink</span> thereof; but the rivers Crathis, Clitummus
                         of Mevania, and Cephisus make <span class="reg">black</span> Cattle white. The waters of  Sinuessa in the country of Campania takes away <span class="reg">barrenness</span> from  both sexes. The river Afrodisius makes women barren: Cabura a <span class="reg">fountain</span> of Mesopotamia <span class="reg">has</span> water of a sweet smell; The water of Anyger in Peloponnesus stinks very much: The <span class="reg">fountain</span> of Jupiter Hammon is cold in the day time, <span class="reg">hot</span> by night, and morning and evening  <span class="reg">lukewarm</span> by <span class="reg">turns</span>. <span class="reg">We</span> need not insist upon others, all things even
                         contrary one to the other are <span class="reg">performed</span> by the Philosophers waters. Of
                         which <span class="reg">Says</span> Lully in his <span class="reg">book</span> of the Quintessence, distin: 3. of inceration; And <span class="reg">so</span> there is a twofold consideration in the art, that is, of
                         the single nature of one <span class="reg">metal</span> to make two contrary liquors in the  composition; one, which <span class="reg">has</span> a fixing, congealing, and <span class="reg">hardening</span> virtue, and the other, which is volatile, unfixed, and soft. But that second liquor is hardened, fixed, and congealed by the first: from both  which liquors results one stone congealed, fixed, and hardened, which
                         <span class="reg">has</span> the virtue of congealing not a thing congealed, to harden a thing
                         <span class="reg">mollified</span>, and to mollify a hard thing: From which it is evident,  what those two waters are, and why to be reduced into one water:  For the Stone is called water, because fusible, and on the contrary,
                         water stone, because frangible: But these waters are <span class="reg">drawn</span> out of  different places, sometimes in a long tract, as may be seen at Rome  about Aqua Virginis, and other <span class="reg">artificial</span> fountains, and then they  must be mixed by conflux, that one may be made of two. For if
                         one be of a <span class="reg">hot</span> and the other of a cold virtue, being mixed together
                         they will acquire <span class="reg">mixed</span> virtues, and after a <span class="reg">wonderful</span> manner regulate one the other: From hence are most excellent <span class="reg">medicinal</span> and
                         bath waters to be produced, which will profligate all sorts of diseases  and <span class="reg">maladies</span>, and restore a man to <span class="reg">firm</span> health. Nature <span class="reg">does</span> indeed by her occult artifice of composition confound and mix many  waters in the <span class="reg">bowels</span> of the earth with <span class="reg">several</span> virtues of <span class="reg">Mines</span>, which
                         are wholesome and <span class="reg">commodious</span> to many <span class="reg">sick</span> and <span class="reg">infirm</span> persons, but
                         if art be added with due regiment, all evacuations being <span class="reg">premised</span> and
                         other things to be <span class="reg">pretermitted</span>, and mix those things that are to be  mixed together, that composition will be <span class="reg">far</span> more <span class="reg">effectual</span>:  Which, though it seem <span class="reg">artificial</span>, is notwithstanding merely <span class="reg">natural</span>,
                         because of things different it is made one simple homogeneous matter,
                        
                        
                        
                        <span class="pb">127</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 40.</span> which can never be effected by art: A mixtion and confusion is indeed caused by art, without the <span class="reg">help</span> of nature <span class="reg">no</span> true and <span class="reg">natural</span> union,  which is made by nature alone: There is an <span class="reg">artificial</span> mixtion of various  simples in Triacle, which is <span class="reg">performed</span> by contrition and fermentation,  but <span class="reg">no</span> man will (except inconsiderately) <span class="reg">affirm</span> it to be a <span class="reg">natural</span> composition, much <span class="reg">less</span> a homogeneous medicament: As to the <span class="reg">artificial</span> mixtion of substances it is manifest, that they <span class="reg">do</span> not enter one  into the other in the least parts, though they cannot <span class="reg">again</span> be divided
                         and separated one from the other by the industry of man. But as to
                         the mixtion of all <span class="reg">qualities</span>
         <span class="reg">we</span> must enquire, whether the first Triacles of all Simples may be reduced not one Quintessence, <span class="del">
            <span class="unclear">xxx</span>
         </span> or yet in their powders or substances be, as before, as accidents in a subject,
                         or <span class="reg">color</span> in a wall; and then what is to be <span class="reg">said</span> of the second, third, and
                         fourth <span class="reg">qualities</span>? Probable it is that all the <span class="reg">qualities</span> are yet <span class="reg">inherent</span> in their <span class="reg">own</span> subjects, and not compounded together by a true <span class="reg">natural</span> mixtion; otherwise, if the <span class="reg">qualities</span> should relinquish their <span class="reg">bodies</span>, there would be four Quintessences in every <span class="superscript">2</span>composition <span class="superscript">1</span>
         <span class="reg">artificial</span>, according to the number of the order of the <span class="reg">qualities</span>, first,  second etc. without their <span class="reg">bodies</span>, and separable; which they say
                         is not <span class="reg">so</span> with the coagulum of a hare, which being in flux  by the tenuity of the blood stops and as it were coagulates it,  but in the coagulation and concretion <span class="reg">cuts</span> and resolves the same;
                         soe the operations of vinegar, lead, and many other things are contrary according to the different use of them, because nature <span class="reg">has</span> soe wonderfully mixed them: <span class="reg">So</span>
         <span class="reg">also</span>
         <span class="reg">has</span> the <span class="reg">Philosophical</span> water different and contrary virtues, because nature <span class="reg">has</span> by the  <span class="reg">help</span> of art mixed it with things contrary into one indivisible  substance, which is nothing <span class="reg">else</span> but a Quintessence, in respect of  other things to be mixed with it . . . . . . . .</div>
