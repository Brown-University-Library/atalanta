      <div class="ab"> As three <span class="reg">essential</span> things, which are the foundation, walls, and <span class="reg">roof</span>, are<span class="milestone">e03-01</span> required to the building of every <span class="reg">edifice</span>, whereof one being absent, there
                         can be <span class="reg">no</span> perfection of it, <span class="reg">so</span> are <span class="reg">so</span> many desired in order to  complete the Philosophers compound, which are here named by their
                         proper names: The author of Aurora, chapt. 20. speaking of the Separation of the Elements, <span class="reg">Says</span>, Earth is left in the same place, that
                         the other three Elements may be radicated in it; if it were not for
                         that, the Elements could have <span class="reg">no</span> foundation to build upon it a new
                         <span class="reg">jewel</span> house: This foundation is here called Aqua fœtida, which is
                         the mother of all the Elements, <span class="reg">witness</span> Rosarius, from which, and
                         by which, and with which the Philosophers <span class="reg">do</span>
         <span class="reg">prepare</span> it, that is,
                         the Elixir in the <span class="reg">beginning</span>, and the end: It is called Aqua fœtida,
                         because it sends forth a Sulphureous <span class="reg">stink</span>, and the smell of Sepulchers:  This is that water, which Pegasus <span class="reg">struck</span> out of Parnassus with his <span class="reg">hoof</span>,  which Nonacris a <span class="reg">mountain</span> of Arcadia <span class="reg">produces</span> springing out of a  <span class="reg">rock</span> at the top, which can <span class="reg">only</span> be contained in the <span class="reg">hoof</span> of a horse by
                         reason of its most excessive strength: This is that Dragons water, as Rosarius calls it, which ought to be made by an <span class="reg">Alembic</span>, without adding  any other thing, in the making of which there is an extraordinary <span class="reg">stink</span>:
                         Which words some having heard <span class="reg">betook</span> themselves to distill the dung of
                         men or other <span class="reg">animals</span>, in which operation they did indeed <span class="reg">feel</span> a most  vehement <span class="reg">stink</span>, but found dung in the dung: But <span class="reg">think</span> not the Philosophers to be Beetles, which operate in dung, you must know that the <span class="reg">stink</span>,
                         if there be any, is presently changed into great fragrancy, as Lully asserts
                         of his Quintessence, to which <span class="reg">he</span> ascribes such a <span class="reg">sweetness</span> of <span class="reg">savor</span>, if
                         it be rightly made, that being placed at the top of a house, it allures  birds flying to it, and <span class="reg">causes</span> them to stand: But <span class="reg">he</span> puts his Quintessence
                         in dung, by the most temperate heat of which that fragrancy <span class="reg">follows</span>,  which some men having <span class="reg">tried</span> with strong wine, but in <span class="reg">vain</span>, did therefore accuse Lully of vanity, whereas themselves ought rather to be  reproved of folly, who never tasted <span class="reg">Lully's</span> wine; but that golden Poet better understood Lully, who in his first <span class="reg">book</span> of Aurifaction thus sings:
                        <div class="verse">
            <br/>At non ille quidem sensit, quæ dicere prima<br/>Est facie visus, neq tum stillantia vina<br/>Miscebat, etc.</div>
         <div class="verse">
            <br/>
            <span class="reg">He</span> thought not what at first <span class="reg">he</span>
            <span class="reg">seemed</span> to say,<br/>Nor then <span class="reg">mixed</span> stilling wines, etc.</div> After Aqua fœtida comes the green <span class="reg">Lion</span>: concerning which <span class="reg">says</span> Rosarius; you have sought for <span class="reg">greenness</span>, supposing, that <span class="reg">brass</span> was a  leprous body, because of that <span class="reg">greenness</span> which it <span class="reg">has</span>: and therefore  I declare to you, that whatsoever is perfect in <span class="reg">brass</span>, is that <span class="reg">greenness</span>
         <span class="pb">118</span>
         <span class="fw">Discourse 37.</span> alone, which is in it: because that <span class="reg">greenness</span> is by our Magistery suddenly
                         turned into our most true gold, and this <span class="reg">we</span> have had experience of:
                         yet you can <span class="reg">no</span> way <span class="reg">prepare</span> the Stone without Duenech green and
                         liquid, which is seen to spring in our <span class="reg">Mines</span>: O blessed <span class="reg">greenness</span>,  which <span class="reg">does</span> generate all things: From whence you must know, that  <span class="reg">no</span> vegetable, and <span class="reg">no</span> fruit appears to germinate without a green  <span class="reg">color</span>: in like manner you must know, that the generation of this thing is
                         green, wherefore the Philosophers call it the bud. These are the words of
                         Rosarius: This is the Philosophers gold, and <span class="reg">brass</span>, and Stone noted in  the Chapters, a fume, <span class="reg">vapor</span> and water, the Spittle of Luna, which is <span class="reg">joined</span> to the light of Sol; This green <span class="reg">Lion</span> fights with the Dragon, but is by him
                         overcome, and in length of time devoured; and the <span class="reg">Lion</span> being <span class="reg">putrefied</span> 
         <span class="reg">sweetness</span> is expected to proceed from his mouth, as being <span class="reg">Slain</span> by Sampson:
                         The Dragon getting the upper hand <span class="reg">so</span> fills <span class="reg">himself</span> with the <span class="reg">Lions</span> flesh, as to burst a little and <span class="reg">die</span>: Of which, the <span class="reg">fat</span> alone of a <span class="reg">Lion</span> curing
                         quotidian <span class="reg">Fevers</span>, and grace and <span class="reg">favor</span> being obtained between Kings  and people <span class="reg">anointed</span> therewith, a most excellent medicine may be made,
                         very <span class="reg">commodious</span> for many <span class="reg">maladies</span>. In the third place <span class="reg">follows</span> the white fume, which, if it be coagulated, becomes water,
                         and performs the office of water in washing, dissolving, and
                         taking away spots like Soap: This is that fire against nature, which see that you find, <span class="reg">so</span> called, because it is  contrary to nature undoing and destroying that, which She
                         with diligent care compounded: This fire is not kindled as
                         the Spirit of wind or <span class="reg">oil</span>, but as an incombustible matter, of  <span class="reg">equal</span> duration and heat, and is a fire without light and combustion of great virtue and efficacy, which to find in <span class="reg">darkness</span> is a
                         thing of <span class="reg">no</span> little difficulty, because it shines not, but of much
                         greater to apply rightly to the <span class="reg">work</span>; the circumstances and  <span class="reg">properties</span> of which <span class="reg">we</span> have sufficiently in <span class="reg">several</span> places described . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</div>
